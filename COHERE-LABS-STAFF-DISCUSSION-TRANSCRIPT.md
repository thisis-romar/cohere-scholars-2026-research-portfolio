**[00:05] Sarah Hooker:** Hello everyone. I'm Sarah Hooker. I lead Cohere's research arm. Today we're talking about the scholars program, which is our bet on finding the best engineers around the world and giving them that first door into AI top-tier research at a frontier lab. 

But to start, I kind of want to take a wider look. So Ahmed, Marzia, like you've been both involved in our scholars program, you look have to look at hundreds and hundreds of applications. How do—what do you think makes a meaningful application? Like what should people think about as they think about applying to our lab?

**[00:46] Marzia:** Yeah, I think our scholar program is very unique in the sense that we are looking for people with very little research background because we want to help them get into research. So it makes it a little bit difficult to evaluate people because they haven't done research. But what I think makes a really good scholar is someone who is curious and passionate and cares about learning, because this is a great learning opportunity both about the problem itself that they will be working on but also just working with the mentors at Cohere and learning about how research is done from everyone. So my—I guess like what I'm always looking for is someone who is very open and curious and wants to learn. So that's very important.

**[01:39] Sarah:** And Ahmed, so you're a very experienced researcher. Who opened that first door for you? Who first got you—gave you your first shot at AI research?

**[01:48] Ahmed:** For AI research, my—I think bachelor supervisor, let me say that that way. But I think beyond not only AI research but I think this is about research—like research motivation to explore something.

**Sarah:** Mhm.

**[02:02] Ahmed:** That is definitely my father because he always pushed me to—okay if you are doing something, do for the depth of it. You know, I think this is the gist of the being research actually. How we also look at the scholar program in my opinion is really like that—if someone is really passionate about exploring something, this is the core skill.

**[02:22] Sarah:** Yeah, and this is a good time—this is a good moment to also ask so what makes for a successful researcher? Like when you look at your colleagues—like what are traits that you think—and not your immediate colleagues, it could be the wider field—but like what traits do you think make for success in research? And John, you are one of our scholars and you've joined as a research engineer. What do you think makes for success in this field?

**[02:47] John:** Yeah, I think there are a couple things that really stand out when I look at great researchers. I think one is being able to ask the right questions—like what Marzia was talking about earlier about curiosity being really important and asking questions that challenge the status quo and conventional ways of thinking are really critical to getting novel ideas off the ground and spurring new research innovation. 

And I think the second thing is just being super collaborative and having the ability to work with people from all sorts of different backgrounds and synthesizing their different points of view to be able to coordinate and work towards a research agenda. I think is really critical to making a lot of the breakthroughs.

**[03:32] Sarah:** Yeah, I agree. We're kind of in an era where there's a huge amount of compute needed for the type of work we do at our lab as well as it's massive infrastructure bets. And so coordination—being able to have discipline in your methodology but also clear hypotheses like failing fast, iterating, learning—I think are really important. 

So what was one thing that was a surprise to you, John, when you chose to kind of join the program? And maybe one thing that you think people don't know about the scholars program.

**[04:03] John:** I think coming in, what I expected was that, you know, the people who were working directly on my project would be my closest collaborators and it'd mostly be talking with them. But I think something really pleasantly surprising was that I think everyone in the entire lab was really invested in my success and had a lot of ideas and thoughts to contribute to my project and my research even if they weren't directly working on the project. And that kind of feedback and insight from people, you know, across the entire team that are working in your project and also have a more outside perspective I think was really helpful in I guess driving the research direction and getting as much perspective and ideas as possible.

**[04:42] Sarah:** And what is your research? Tell us about it and also why is it very critical to this particular era of AI.

**[04:49] John:** So when I joined as a research scholar a year ago, I joined to work on getting reinforcement learning from human feedback or preference training—which has become a really standard critical piece of training state-of-the-art foundation models—and making it work in multilingual settings. So when we look widely at the field currently, most of the work in getting our models to be more aligned to human preferences have been really mostly exclusively focused on high resource languages like English. And as a result, what we find is that many of these models perform not very well and often means that, you know, people who don't speak English or these high resource languages are often excluded from access to these technologies which are becoming increasingly important. So I was working on trying to bring these state-of-the-art alignment techniques to multilingual models and making them effective for improving the multilingual performance of these models across a wide variety of languages.

**[05:47] Sarah:** Yeah, I think alignment is—and this steering of models because we're kind of steering the models to what we think humans care about. This is really at the heart of making that much more realistic for the complexity of the world because when we steer traditionally it's been towards I guess a single global preference and we all know that's not true. And this first gets us thinking about multi-objective—there's many different preferences and we have to create models which can adapt and understand and balance different objectives. So this is really profound. 

I want to open it up. I want to ask so, you know, Marzia, Ahmed, what's one piece of advice that you would give to your younger research self and that you would give, you know, to scholars who are just starting out?

**[06:33] Marzia:** I think I guess for me—

**[06:35] Sarah:** No pressure.

**[06:35] Marzia:** Yeah, it is a lesson that I learned over time and I usually now say that to—if I'm mentoring someone but I would have also mentored my younger self and I would say that is just how to view failures as a point of learning. It might be a little bit like a cliche but really the best learning lessons happen when failures happen and that can be in your—in the actual experiment that you're running, the hypothesis that you had that you are validating, but also in general in life like what you think might be something you want at one point and you don't get—learning from that and get better and move. That's...

**[07:21] Sarah:** Perseverance is crucial ingredient of just really developing anything that is unknown. But it's—I often say one of the core ingredients is just being the last one working on the problem. It's a balance but I do think this is a core component of even really being successful as you're just starting out in anything. You have to build a craft which often just involves repetition to begin with. 

And almost everyone who ends up at the frontier of AI who's very accomplished, they've all developed the craft. And then what happens after that is the magic of having like a research taste and a perspective. But to get there, you first just have to build that craft. It's kind of like any type of really specialization or being an expert in everything. There's a lot of repetition and perseverance initially. 

I want to ask a question. Maybe I'll switch it on. So, I think this is one aspect that I'm quite proud about is that we scholars—one of the key goals is to still publish. We've seen this closing down of publishing in industry labs. I guess there's—why is that trend happening and you know why is it so important that we still have programs that publish and release work.

**[08:29] Ahmed:** I think this trend happens because of the reality of AI now—the fast adoption also comes with the financial outcome.

**[08:37] Sarah:** Yeah.

**[08:37] Ahmed:** And like there's a huge competition because of the same reason—because of the financial outcome that leads AI labs to publish less. The one thing that is sort of missing in this formulation is like when we publish less then this adoption and this pace will eventually slow down. So to keep this pace same or even go beyond we have to do research, we have to do open science and we have to publish. That's why I feel super lucky that as a lab we really publish not only publish with the stuff but also really open up entry points for junior researcher—new superstars. I think this is because this really kind of two-way thing—as we publish more we have this open up entry points when we have more entry points when we lots of new junior researchers then we actually publish better. So I think that's—yeah that's what I think about that.

**[09:31] Sarah:** Yeah. So if you come to our events, we'll actually share what we're working on. But this was very nice, amazing. I think the scholars program is one of the pillars of how we innovate and how we work on the next generation models. So thanks everyone for sharing your perspective. So Ahmed and Marzia and John often mentoring the scholars projects and John joined us from the scholars program. So it's really nice to have your perspective as people think about this.
