## Executive Summary

This groundbreaking research establishes the **first comprehensive benchmark for continual learning in LLMs**, investigating how models adapt to evolving domains while preserving previously learned knowledge. Through systematic evaluation across 159 domains from the M2D2 dataset with models ranging from GPT-2 to Llama2-7B, this study reveals **fundamental scaling laws for continual pretraining** and provides crucial insights for building adaptive AI systems that can efficiently incorporate new knowledge streams without catastrophic forgetting.

### Core Innovation: Large-Scale Continual Learning Benchmark
Unlike previous studies focusing on limited domains or tasks, this research leverages the **Massively Multi-Domain Dataset (M2D2)** with 236 hierarchically organized domains spanning 8.5 billion tokens from Wikipedia and Semantic Scholar, creating the most realistic evaluation of knowledge retention and transfer in LLMs to date.

### Key Breakthrough Findings:
- **Model Scale Dependencies**: Continual pretraining **consistently improves <1.5B models** but paradoxically **degrades Llama2-7B** performance
