**PARADIGM SHIFT: Tool → Teammate Evaluation**
This research fundamentally redefines AI evaluation by introducing **collaborative memory assessment** - moving beyond single-task performance to evaluate LLMs as persistent coding partners across multiple sessions.

**Key Innovation:** MEMORYCODE - First multi-session dataset testing **prospective memory** and **spontaneous retrieval** in practical coding contexts without explicit cues.

### 🔬 Methodology Deep Dive

#### **MEMORYCODE Dataset Architecture**

**Synthetic Multi-Session Design:**
- **360 dialogue histories** across 12 session lengths (1-100 sessions)
- **Mentor-mentee framework** simulating realistic onboarding scenarios
- **51 coding instructions** with updates (16 updatable up to 8 times)
- **80 filler topics** creating realistic information density
- **Range:** Short (<15 sessions, 54%) vs Long (16-100 sessions, 46%)

**Evaluation Hierarchy:**
1. **INSTRUCTION:** Single instruction execution (baseline capability)
2. **SESSION:** Full session with multiple instructions + fillers
3. **HISTORY:** Complete multi-session dialogue (collaborative memory test)

**Assessment Framework:**
- **Regex-based verification** for instruction compliance
- **Macro-averaged accuracy** across all instruction instances
