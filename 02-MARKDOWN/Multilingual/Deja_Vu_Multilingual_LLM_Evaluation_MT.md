## Experimental Validation

### Key Findings

#### Translation Impact Analysis
- **Round-trip Translation Experiment**: 250 Aya human-annotated prompts across 5 languages
- **Translation Quality Range**: XCOMET scores 90.03-93.65 across different translation systems
- **Win-Rate Sensitivity**: Translation artifacts systematically favor models robust to translationese
- **Language-Specific Effects**: Chinese and Turkish show highest sensitivity to translation quality

#### Statistical Significance Assessment
- **mArenaHard Analysis**: 500 prompts across 23 languages comparing Aya Expanse 8B vs. Qwen2.5 7B
- **Sample Size Dependency**: Hebrew requires fewer samples for significance than Chinese
- **Power Analysis Implications**: Most current benchmarks likely underpowered for reliable comparisons

#### Aggregation Strategy Impact
- **European Leaderboard Analysis**: Top-5 system rankings vary significantly by language grouping
- **Resource-Level Effects**: Model performance patterns differ across high/medium/low-resource languages
- **Task-Specific Variations**: MMLU vs. GSM8k performance creates different ranking hierarchies

### Multilingual vs. Monolingual Performance
- Comprehensive comparison across French, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, and Japanese
- Multilingual models consistently outperform monolingual counterparts in open-ended generation
- Performance advantage holds across diverse evaluation contexts (general knowledge, math/reasoning)

## Benchmark Ecosystem Analysis

### Current Landscape Assessment
