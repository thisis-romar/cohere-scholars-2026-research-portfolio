# Comprehensive Analysis: MURI: High-Quality Instruction Tuning Datasets for Low-Resource Languages via Reverse Instructions

## Executive Summary

This paper introduces MURI (Multilingual Reverse Instructions), a novel methodology for generating high-quality instruction tuning datasets for low-resource languages without requiring human annotators or pre-existing multilingual models. By utilizing reverse instruction generation combined with machine translation, MURI creates culturally authentic instruction-output pairs where the outputs are human-written in their original languages, avoiding translationese artifacts that plague existing approaches.
