## Abstract

Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation capabilities of the model post-training to new languages.

We focus on **tokenizer design** and propose using a **universal tokenizer** that is trained for more languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with **up to 20.2% increase in win rates** compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining languages. 

Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining, by **up to 5% win rate gain**. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages included in pretraining.

## 1. Introduction

There are only a handful of research labs with enough compute resources and expertise to train large AI systems at scale. Most researchers and practitioners are forced to choose among available pretrained models for downstream tasks, even if they are not tailored to their use cases. Nowhere is this tension more evident than in the multilingual setting, where limited investment in multilingual support in pretraining often results in significant gaps in language coverage in state-of-the-art LLMs.

### The Global AI Divide

This imbalance in language coverage has created a growing divide in the cost of use for particular language users as **marginalized languages require more tokens and incur higher latency** for generations, restricting speakers of low-performing languages to lower quality technology. Further compounding these issues, once a model is pretrained, it is hard to steer towards new behavior using post-training alone. Unless the tokenizer has been calibrated to a new language during training, it often requires far more significant amount of data and intricate optimization steps.

### Language Plasticity

**Multilingual plasticity** represents the capability of the language model to quickly adapt to lingual distribution shifts to the downstream target, which in our case, involves a new set of focus languages. Given that pretraining requires the bulk of compute and cost resources, any intervention made at this stage that improves the plasticity for downstream developers and researchers is beneficial.

### Our Approach

In this work, we investigate minimal and efficient pretraining interventions to reduce later adaptation costs. In particular, we identify **tokenization as an area with relatively low cost of intervention, but potential for large downstream gains**. We ask: **Can we leverage tokenizers with broad language coverage to improve the plasticity of LLMs without hurting pretraining performance?**

We hypothesize that a **universal tokenizer** that is trained on more languages than the primary pretraining languages, introduced from the start of pretraining, enables quick and effective interventions for adapting a model to new languages.

## 2. Key Innovations and Results

### 2.1 Universal Tokenizer Framework

**Core Innovation:** Train a tokenizer on a broader set of languages (69 languages) than those used in primary pretraining, using a specialized weighting scheme that balances:
1. **Natural distribution** of data available across languages
2. **Language buckets** formed by languages sharing script and family

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
wi = (wd_i · wb_i) / Σ(wd_n · wb_n)
```
Where `wd_i` represents data distribution weights and `wb_i` represents language bucket weights.

**Adaptation Strategies Evaluated:**
1. **Continued pretraining** with both primary and expanded languages
2. **Targeted adaptation** for expanded languages only
3. **Targeted adaptation** for fully unseen languages
