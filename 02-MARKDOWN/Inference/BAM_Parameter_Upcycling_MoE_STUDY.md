## Abstract Summary

This research introduces BAM (Branch-Attend-Mix), a revolutionary approach to parameter upcycling for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models that dramatically improves upon existing methods by leveraging both FFN and attention parameters from specialized dense models. Unlike previous approaches that only utilize FFN layers, BAM implements a soft-variant Mixture of Attention (MoA) framework with parallel attention transformer architecture, achieving superior performance across models ranging from 590M to 2B parameters while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Full Parameter Utilization**: How can we maximize the benefits of specialized dense models by leveraging both FFN and attention parameters rather than limiting reuse to FFN layers only?

2. **Soft vs Sparse Routing**: What are the trade-offs between soft routing (assigning tokens to all experts) versus traditional top-k sparse routing in attention expert layers?

3. **Computational Efficiency Balance**: How can we offset increased computational costs from attention experts while maintaining performance improvements through architectural innovations?

4. **Specialization vs Generalization**: What is the optimal balance between domain-specific expertise and general capability preservation in upcycled MoE models?

## Methodology Framework

### BAM Three-Phase Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Branching
- **Seed Model Creation**: Start with pre-trained dense model using parallel attention transformer architecture
- **Domain Replication**: Create N copies for specialized training across different domains
- **Architecture Choice**: Parallel attention enables concurrent computation of attention and FFN experts
- **Foundation**: Leverages existing pre-trained knowledge rather than random initialization

#### Phase 2: Continued Pre-training  
- **Domain Specialization**: Independent training on specialized data mixtures (law, mathematics, coding)
- **Training Volume**: 100 billion tokens per expert for deep domain expertise
- **Data Augmentation**: 10% Common Crawl data mixed with domain-specific content for distribution matching
- **Expertise Development**: Each model develops enhanced performance within specialization while potentially degrading in other domains

#### Phase 3: Mixture Model Training
- **Comprehensive Parameter Transfer**: Unlike BTX (FFN-only), BAM leverages both FFN and attention parameters
- **Router Initialization**: Random initialization for both FFN and attention routing layers
- **Parameter Averaging**: Non-expert parameters (layer norm, embeddings) initialized via uniform averaging
- **Seed Model Integration**: Include original pre-trained model to preserve general knowledge

### Technical Innovation: Attention Expert Architecture

#### 1. Soft-Routing Mixture of Attention
- **Token Assignment**: Each token assigned to ALL attention experts (not top-k subset)
- **Routing Mechanism**: g(x) = softmax(W_attn_router · x) with continuous weighting
- **Output Computation**: MHA_MoA = Σ g_i(x)MHA_i(x) across all experts
- **Training Stability**: Eliminates discrete optimization challenges of traditional top-k routing

#### 2. Two Attention Expert Variants
- **Expert KV**: All attention parameters (Q, K, V, O projections) specialized per expert
- **Shared KV**: Key-value projections shared across experts, only Q and O projections specialized
- **Performance vs Efficiency**: Expert KV maximizes performance, Shared KV optimizes inference speed
- **Memory Management**: Shared KV reduces memory pressure from individual KV caches

#### 3. Parallel Attention Transformer Integration
- **Concurrent Computation**: Attention experts and FFN experts computed simultaneously
- **Throughput Enhancement**: Parallel processing masks additional computation overhead
- **Expert Parallelism**: Individual FFNs and attention computed in parallel across experts
- **Architectural Advantage**: Inherited from parallel attention seed model architecture

### Advanced Training Methodology

#### Loss Function Optimization
- **Primary Loss**: Negative log-likelihood L_NLL for standard language modeling
- **Load Balancing**: L_LB = N Σ f_i P_i to encourage uniform expert utilization
- **Router Stabilization**: L_z = (1/B) Σ (LogSumExp(x_j))² to prevent large logits
- **Combined Objective**: L = L_NLL + α L_LB + β L_z with hyperparameter weighting

#### Training Stability Enhancements
- **Learning Rate Adaptation**: 50% of pre-training rate for continued pre-training phase
- **Gradient Spike Mitigation**: Reduced peak learning rate (1e-4) for large-scale mixture training
- **Warm-up Adjustment**: 1000 steps warm-up for mixture phase vs 2000 for pre-training
- **Cosine Decay**: 10% of peak rate final decay for stable convergence

## Major Findings

### 1. Comprehensive Parameter Utilization Superiority

**Key Discovery**: Full utilization of specialized dense model parameters (both FFN and attention) dramatically outperforms FFN-only approaches.

**Evidence**:
- **Perplexity Improvement**: BAM consistently outperforms BTX across all domains and model scales
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Superior performance even when BTX uses 6-8 FFN experts vs BAM's 4
- **Specialization Preservation**: Avoids performance degradation from averaging divergent attention parameters
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Maximizes utilization of domain-specific expertise embedded in attention layers

**Strategic Implications**: Traditional parameter averaging approaches significantly underutilize specialized model capabilities, requiring fundamental architectural rethinking.

### 2. Soft-Routing Critical for Attention Experts

**Key Discovery**: Soft routing (assigning tokens to all attention experts) essential for surpassing baseline performance, unlike traditional top-k sparse routing.

**Evidence**:
- **Performance Comparison**: BAM with soft-routing outperforms BTX across all domains
- **Top-k Failure**: BAM with top-1 and top-2 attention routing shows no improvement over baseline
- **Training Stability**: Soft routing eliminates discrete optimization challenges and imbalanced load issues
- **Expert Utilization**: Continuous weighting allows nuanced combination of specialized capabilities

**Technical Insight**: Attention mechanisms require different routing strategies than FFN layers, with continuous assignment enabling better specialization integration.

### 3. Computational Efficiency Through Architectural Innovation

**Key Discovery**: Parallel attention transformer architecture effectively masks additional computational overhead from attention experts.

**Evidence**:
- **FLOPs Analysis**: BAM requires 48.3M FLOPs vs BTX's 21.5M, but parameter-matched BTX requires 46.7M FLOPs
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent attention and FFN expert computation reduces effective overhead
- **Memory Optimization**: Shared KV variant reduces inference latency from 6.17s to 5.96s
- **Expert Parallelism**: Individual expert computations distributed across parallel processing units

**Engineering Insight**: Smart architectural choices can significantly offset theoretical computational increases through practical implementation optimizations.

### 4. Scale-Dependent Performance Improvements

**Key Discovery**: Performance benefits of BAM increase with model scale, demonstrating favorable scaling properties.

**Evidence**:
- **Small-Scale (590M)**: Consistent but modest improvements across domains
- **Large-Scale (2B)**: More pronounced performance advantages and better downstream task performance
- **Benchmark Evaluation**: All BAM variants outperform BTX on average across evaluation tasks
- **Domain Specialization**: Maintains expert performance advantages while improving generalization
