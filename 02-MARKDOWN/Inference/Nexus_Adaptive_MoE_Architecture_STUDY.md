## Executive Summary

This groundbreaking research introduces **Nexus**, a revolutionary MoE architecture that solves the fundamental tension between efficiency, specialization, and adaptability in LLMs. Building directly on the foundation we established with BAM parameter upcycling, Nexus creates **the first truly adaptive MoE system** where new experts can be seamlessly added without massive retraining. This represents a paradigm shift toward **modular AI ecosystems** where models continuously evolve through community-driven expert contributions.

### Core Innovation: Domain-Aware Adaptive Routing
Unlike traditional MoE routers that learn from scratch, Nexus employs **domain projection-based routing** where expert embeddings are learned from pre-computed domain representations. This enables:
- **Immediate Integration**: New experts can be added post-training using only domain embeddings
- **Preserved Specialization**: Each expert maintains clear domain expertise (69.8% routing accuracy for Wikipedia)
- **Efficient Scaling**: Router adapts automatically without parameter count dependencies

## Technical Architecture Deep Dive

### 1. Adaptive Router Mechanism

The revolutionary breakthrough lies in Nexus's routing strategy:

```
Traditional MoE: R(x) = softmax(W_r^T × x)
Nexus Router: ei = Pr(di) → si = softmax(x · ei)
```

**Key Components:**
- **Domain Embeddings (di)**: Pre-computed representations using Cohere Embed v3
- **Projection Network (Pr)**: 2-layer MLP with SwiGLU activation learning domain-to-expert mapping
- **Expert Embeddings (ei)**: Dynamically computed representations enabling adaptive routing

### 2. Upcycling Architecture

Nexus builds on specialized dense experts with critical improvements:

**Expert Integration:**
- **Shared Expert Strategy**: Original seed model FFN serves as always-active shared expert
- **Routed Experts**: Domain-specific FFN layers from separately trained specialists
- **Parameter Merging**: Non-FFN weights averaged across all experts for stability

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
FFN_moe = FFN_s + [FFN_e1, FFN_e2, ..., FFN_en]
φ_moe = Σ(φ_i)/n (for non-FFN parameters)
y = E0(x) + Σ(sk · Ek(x)) (shared + routed output)
```

### 3. Dynamic Expert Extension

The game-changing capability for **post-training adaptation**:

**Extension Process:**
1. Train new dense expert on target domain
2. Compute domain embedding for new dataset
3. Generate expert embedding: e_new = Pr(d_new)
4. Append FFN to existing expert array
5. Lightweight finetuning with limited tokens

**Parameter Preservation:**
```
φ_final = (1-λ) · φ_moe + λ · φ_new
where λ = 1/(n+1)
```
