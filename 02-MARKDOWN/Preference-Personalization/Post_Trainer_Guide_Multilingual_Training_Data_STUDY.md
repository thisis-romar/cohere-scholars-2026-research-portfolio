## Abstract Summary

This comprehensive study examines cross-lingual transfer (CLT) dynamics in realistic post-training settings using models up to 35B parameters trained on carefully controlled multilingual data mixtures. The research investigates three generative tasks with varying complexity levels (summarization, instruction following, mathematical reasoning) across both single-task and multi-task instruction tuning settings to understand how multilingual performance transfer operates in practice.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Task Dependency**: How do different task types influence multilingual performance improvements and cross-lingual transfer effectiveness?

2. **Scale Impact**: How does model size affect cross-lingual transfer efficiency and the performance gap between seen and unseen languages?

3. **Training Settings**: How do single-task versus multi-task training environments impact cross-lingual transfer dynamics and performance stability?

4. **Data Composition**: How do different language script groupings (Latin vs non-Latin) affect transfer effectiveness across various task types?

## Methodology Framework

### Experimental Design
- **Models**: Aya 23 (7B/35B) and Llama 3.1 (8B) base models
- **Languages**: Fixed set of 4 training languages (Spanish, French, Japanese, simplified Chinese) plus English
- **Tasks**: Summarization (XLSum), Instruction Following (ShareGPT + Command-R+), Mathematical Reasoning (mCoT-Math/MGSM)
- **Data Scaling**: Incremental addition from 10k English samples to 75k total samples per run
- **Evaluation Languages**: Seen (es, fr, ja, zh) and Unseen (ar, ko, pt) languages

### Training Configuration
- Full-model fine-tuning (not LoRA)
- Batch size: 64 (unpacked data)
- Learning rate: 1e-5 (constant)
- Hardware: v5-64 and v5-256 TPUs
- Validation-based checkpoint selection

## Major Findings

### 1. Task-Dependent Multilingual Performance Scaling

**Key Discovery**: Different tasks exhibit dramatically different sensitivity to multilingual data addition.

**Evidence**:
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: Requires ~13x more multilingual data than other tasks to reach peak performance
- **Instruction Following & Summarization**: Performance plateaus after only 400 samples per language
- **Performance Gaps**: MR shows 22.7% improvement with multilingual data (7B models), while IF/SM show 6.8-8.7%

**Strategic Implications**: Resource allocation for multilingual instruction tuning must be task-specific, with reasoning tasks requiring substantially more multilingual investment.

### 2. Scale-Dependent Cross-lingual Transfer Efficiency

**Key Discovery**: Larger models achieve more efficient cross-lingual transfer with diminishing returns from additional multilingual data.

**Evidence**:
- **35B Models**: Plateau after 200-400 samples per language across all tasks
- **7B Models**: Show continuous improvement patterns, especially for mathematical reasoning
- **Gap Reduction**: Initial English-non-English performance gap significantly reduced in larger models
- **Transfer Correlation**: Strong correlation between seen/unseen language performance in smaller models (0.67-0.88), decreasing with scale

**Strategic Implications**: Large-scale models achieve most cross-lingual transfer benefits from English data alone, suggesting efficient resource utilization strategies.

### 3. Multi-task vs Single-task Training Dynamics

**Key Discovery**: Multi-task training introduces performance oscillations and task interference, but benefits emerge at scale.

**Evidence**:
- **7B Multi-task**: Mathematical reasoning performance drops 8% due to task interference
- **35B Multi-task**: Matches single-task peak performance with less task-specific data
- **Performance Stability**: Large models show reduced oscillation patterns in multi-task settings
- **Cross-task Benefits**: Summarization benefits from mixed training at scale despite seeing half the task-specific data

**Strategic Implications**: Multi-task training requires careful consideration of model scale and task interference patterns for optimal performance.

### 4. Language Script Grouping Effects

**Key Discovery**: Task type determines optimal language script composition for training effectiveness.

**Evidence**:
- **Linguistic Tasks** (IF, Summarization): Require non-Latin script languages for optimal performance across diverse writing systems
- **Reasoning Tasks** (Mathematics): Benefit more from Latin-script-only training (37.4% vs 36.6% peak performance)
- **Transfer Limitations**: Cross-lingual transfer from Latin script languages insufficient for non-Latin script performance

**Strategic Implications**: Language selection strategies should align with task characteristics—linguistic tasks need script diversity, reasoning tasks can focus on Latin scripts.
