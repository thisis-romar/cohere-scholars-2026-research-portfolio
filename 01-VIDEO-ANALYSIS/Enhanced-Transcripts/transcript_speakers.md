Hello everyone. I'm Sarah Hooker. I lead Hello everyone. I'm Sarah Hooker. I lead Hello everyone. I'm Sarah Hooker. I lead Coher's research arm. Uh today we're Coher's research arm.

Uh today we're talking about the scholars program and talking about the scholars program and which is our bet on finding the best which is our bet on finding the best which is our bet on finding the best engineers around the world and giving engineers around the world and giving them that first door into AI top tier them that first door into AI top tier them that first door into AI top tier research at a frontier lab.

Um but to research at a frontier lab. Um but to start I kind of want to um take a wider start I kind of want to um take a wider start I kind of want to um take a wider look. So um Ahmed Marzia like you've look.

So um Ahmed Marzia like you've been both involved in art scholars been both involved in art scholars program you look have to look at program you look have to look at hundreds and hundreds of applications hundreds and hundreds of applications uh how do what do you think makes a you uh how do what do you think makes a you uh how do what do you think makes a you know a meaningful application like what know a meaningful application like what should people think about as they think should people think about as they think about applying to our lab? about applying to our lab? &gt;&gt; Uh yeah I think our scholar program is &gt;&gt; Uh yeah I think our scholar program is &gt;&gt; Uh yeah I think our scholar program is very unique in the sense that we are very unique in the sense that we are very unique in the sense that we are looking for people with very little looking for people with very little research background because we want to research background because we want to help them get into research.

So uh it's help them get into research.

So uh it's it makes it a little bit difficult to uh it makes it a little bit difficult to uh it makes it a little bit difficult to uh evaluate people because they haven't evaluate people because they haven't done research.

uh but uh what I think done research.

uh but uh what I think makes a really good scholar is someone makes a really good scholar is someone who is curious and passionate and cares who is curious and passionate and cares about learning and uh because this is a about learning and uh because this is a about learning and uh because this is a great learning opportunity both about great learning opportunity both about the problem itself that they will be the problem itself that they will be working on but also just working with working on but also just working with the mentors uh at coher and uh learning the mentors uh at coher and uh learning the mentors uh at coher and uh learning about how research is done from about how research is done from everyone.

So uh my uh I guess like what everyone.

So uh my uh I guess like what I I'm always looking for is someone who I I'm always looking for is someone who I I'm always looking for is someone who is uh very uh open and curious and wants is uh very uh open and curious and wants is uh very uh open and curious and wants to learn.

So that's uh very important. to learn. So that's uh very important. to learn. So that's uh very important. And Ahmed, so you're a very experienced And Ahmed, so you're a very experienced researcher. Who opened that first door researcher.

Who opened that first door for you? Who first got you gave you your for you? Who first got you gave you your for you? Who first got you gave you your first shot at AI research? first shot at AI research? &gt;&gt; Um, for AI research, my I think bachelor &gt;&gt; Um, for AI research, my I think bachelor &gt;&gt; Um, for AI research, my I think bachelor uh supervisor uh let me say that that uh supervisor uh let me say that that uh supervisor uh let me say that that way.

But uh I think beyond not only AI way. But uh I think beyond not only AI research but I think this is about research but I think this is about research like research motivation to research like research motivation to explore something.

explore something.

&gt;&gt; That is definitely my father because he &gt;&gt; That is definitely my father because he &gt;&gt; That is definitely my father because he always pushed me to okay if you are always pushed me to okay if you are always pushed me to okay if you are doing something do for the depth of it doing something do for the depth of it doing something do for the depth of it you know I think this is the gist of the you know I think this is the gist of the you know I think this is the gist of the being research actually how we also look being research actually how we also look at the scholar program in my opinion is at the scholar program in my opinion is at the scholar program in my opinion is really like that if someone is really really like that if someone is really passionate about exploring something passionate about exploring something this is the core skill this is the core skill &gt;&gt; yeah and this is a good time this is a &gt;&gt; yeah and this is a good time this is a &gt;&gt; yeah and this is a good time this is a good moment to also ask so what what good moment to also ask so what what good moment to also ask so what what makes for a successful researcher like makes for a successful researcher like when you look at uh your colleagues like when you look at uh your colleagues like when you look at uh your colleagues like what are traits that you think and not what are traits that you think and not what are traits that you think and not your media colleagues it could be the your media colleagues it could be the wider field but like what traits do you wider field but like what traits do you wider field but like what traits do you think uh make for success in research think uh make for success in research and John you are one of our scholars and and John you are one of our scholars and and John you are one of our scholars and you've joined as a research engineer um you've joined as a research engineer um what do you think makes for um success what do you think makes for um success what do you think makes for um success in this field in this field &gt;&gt; yeah I think there there are a couple &gt;&gt; yeah I think there there are a couple &gt;&gt; yeah I think there there are a couple things that really stand out when I look things that really stand out when I look things that really stand out when I look at great researchers um I think one is at great researchers um I think one is at great researchers um I think one is being able to ask the right questions being able to ask the right questions like what Marzia um was talking about like what Marzia um was talking about earlier about curiosity being really earlier about curiosity being really important and um asking questions that important and um asking questions that challenge the status quo and challenge the status quo and conventional ways of thinking are really conventional ways of thinking are really critical to getting novel ideas um off critical to getting novel ideas um off the ground and spurring new research the ground and spurring new research innovation.

Um, and I think the second innovation.

Um, and I think the second thing is just being super collaborative thing is just being super collaborative and having the ability to work with and having the ability to work with people from all sorts of different people from all sorts of different backgrounds and synthesizing their backgrounds and synthesizing their different points of view to be able to different points of view to be able to different points of view to be able to coordinate and um, work towards a coordinate and um, work towards a research agenda I think is really research agenda I think is really critical to uh, making a lot of the critical to uh, making a lot of the critical to uh, making a lot of the breakthroughs.

breakthroughs. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. We're kind of in an era &gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree.

We're kind of in an era of where there's a huge amount of of where there's a huge amount of compute needed for the type of work we compute needed for the type of work we compute needed for the type of work we do at our lab as well as it's massive do at our lab as well as it's massive do at our lab as well as it's massive infrastructure bets and so coordination infrastructure bets and so coordination being able to have discipline in your u being able to have discipline in your u being able to have discipline in your u methodology but also clear hypotheses methodology but also clear hypotheses like failing fast iterating learning I like failing fast iterating learning I think are really important.

Um, so what think are really important.

Um, so what was one thing that was a surprise to was one thing that was a surprise to was one thing that was a surprise to you, John, when you chose to kind of you, John, when you chose to kind of you, John, when you chose to kind of join the program? Uh, and maybe one join the program? Uh, and maybe one thing that you think people uh don't thing that you think people uh don't know about the scholars program.

know about the scholars program.

&gt;&gt; I think coming in what I expected was &gt;&gt; I think coming in what I expected was &gt;&gt; I think coming in what I expected was that, you know, the people who were that, you know, the people who were working directly on my project would be working directly on my project would be u my closest collaborators and it mostly u my closest collaborators and it mostly be talking with them.

But I think be talking with them.

But I think something really uh pleasantly something really uh pleasantly surprising was that I think everyone in surprising was that I think everyone in the entire lab was really invested in my the entire lab was really invested in my the entire lab was really invested in my success and had a lot of ideas and success and had a lot of ideas and success and had a lot of ideas and thoughts to contribute to my project and thoughts to contribute to my project and my research even if they weren't my research even if they weren't directly working on the project.

And directly working on the project.

And that kind of feedback and insight from that kind of feedback and insight from people you know across the entire team people you know across the entire team that are working in your project and that are working in your project and also have a more outside perspective I also have a more outside perspective I think was really helpful in I guess think was really helpful in I guess driving um the research direction and driving um the research direction and getting as much perspective and ideas as getting as much perspective and ideas as possible possible possible &gt;&gt; and what is your research tell us about &gt;&gt; and what is your research tell us about &gt;&gt; and what is your research tell us about it and also why is it very critical to it and also why is it very critical to it and also why is it very critical to this particular era of AI.

So when I this particular era of AI.

So when I joined as a research scholar um a year joined as a research scholar um a year joined as a research scholar um a year ago uh I joined to work on um getting uh ago uh I joined to work on um getting uh ago uh I joined to work on um getting uh reinforce and learning from human reinforce and learning from human feedback or preference training which is feedback or preference training which is become a really standard critical piece become a really standard critical piece of training state-of-the-art foundation of training state-of-the-art foundation models and making it work in uh models and making it work in uh multilingual settings.

So when we look multilingual settings.

So when we look widely at the field currently uh most of widely at the field currently uh most of widely at the field currently uh most of the works in getting our models to be the works in getting our models to be the works in getting our models to be more aligned to human preferences have more aligned to human preferences have been really mostly exclusively focused been really mostly exclusively focused on high resource languages like English on high resource languages like English and as a result what we find is that and as a result what we find is that and as a result what we find is that many of these models perform not very many of these models perform not very well and um often means that you know well and um often means that you know well and um often means that you know people who don't uh speak English or people who don't uh speak English or these high resource languages are often these high resource languages are often excluded from access to these excluded from access to these technologies which are becoming technologies which are becoming increasingly important.

So I was working increasingly important.

So I was working on trying to bring these on trying to bring these state-of-the-art alignment techniques to state-of-the-art alignment techniques to uh multilingual models and making them uh multilingual models and making them effective for improving the multilingual effective for improving the multilingual performance of these models across a performance of these models across a wide variety of languages.

wide variety of languages.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think alignment is uh and this &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think alignment is uh and this &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think alignment is uh and this steering of models because we're kind of steering of models because we're kind of steering the models to what we think um steering the models to what we think um steering the models to what we think um humans care about.

This is really uh at humans care about.

This is really uh at the heart of making that much more the heart of making that much more realistic for the complexity of the realistic for the complexity of the world because when we steer world because when we steer traditionally it's been towards I guess traditionally it's been towards I guess a single global preference and we all a single global preference and we all know that's not true and this first gets know that's not true and this first gets know that's not true and this first gets us thinking about multi-objective us thinking about multi-objective there's many different preferences and there's many different preferences and we have to create models which can adapt we have to create models which can adapt we have to create models which can adapt and understand and balance different and understand and balance different objectives so this is really profound um objectives so this is really profound um I want to open it up I want to ask so I want to open it up I want to ask so I want to open it up I want to ask so you know um Marsia Ahmed, what's one you know um Marsia Ahmed, what's one piece of advice that you would give to piece of advice that you would give to piece of advice that you would give to your younger research self and that you your younger research self and that you would give you know to scholars who are would give you know to scholars who are would give you know to scholars who are just starting out? just starting out? &gt;&gt; I think I guess for me &gt;&gt; I think I guess for me &gt;&gt; no pressure.

&gt;&gt; no pressure.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it it is a lesson that I learned &gt;&gt; Yeah, it it is a lesson that I learned &gt;&gt; Yeah, it it is a lesson that I learned over time and uh I usually now say that over time and uh I usually now say that over time and uh I usually now say that to if I'm mentoring someone but I would to if I'm mentoring someone but I would to if I'm mentoring someone but I would have also mentored my younger self and I have also mentored my younger self and I have also mentored my younger self and I would say that is just how to view would say that is just how to view would say that is just how to view failures as a point of learning.

Uh it failures as a point of learning.

Uh it might be a little bit like a cliche but might be a little bit like a cliche but might be a little bit like a cliche but really uh the the best learning lessons really uh the the best learning lessons happen when failures happen and that can happen when failures happen and that can be in your uh in in the actual be in your uh in in the actual be in your uh in in the actual experiment that you're running the experiment that you're running the hypothesis that you had that you are hypothesis that you had that you are validating uh but also in general in in validating uh but also in general in in validating uh but also in general in in life like what you think might be life like what you think might be something you want at one point and you something you want at one point and you something you want at one point and you don't get uh learning from that and get don't get uh learning from that and get don't get uh learning from that and get better and move.

That's better and move. That's &gt;&gt; perseverance is crucial ingredient of um &gt;&gt; perseverance is crucial ingredient of um just really developing anything that is just really developing anything that is unknown.

But it's um I often say one of unknown. But it's um I often say one of the core ingredients is just being the the core ingredients is just being the last one working on the problem. It's a last one working on the problem.

It's a balance but I do think this is a core balance but I do think this is a core balance but I do think this is a core component of even uh really being component of even uh really being successful as you're just starting out successful as you're just starting out in anything.

You have to build a craft in anything. You have to build a craft which often just involves repetition to which often just involves repetition to begin with. Um, and almost everyone who begin with.

Um, and almost everyone who ends up at the frontier of AI who's very ends up at the frontier of AI who's very ends up at the frontier of AI who's very accomplished, they've all developed the accomplished, they've all developed the craft.

And then what happens after that craft. And then what happens after that is the magic of having like a research is the magic of having like a research is the magic of having like a research taste and a perspective. But to get taste and a perspective.

But to get there, you first just have to build that there, you first just have to build that there, you first just have to build that craft. It's kind of like any type of um craft.

It's kind of like any type of um really uh specialization or being an really uh specialization or being an expert in everything. There's a lot of expert in everything. There's a lot of repetition and perseverance initially.

repetition and perseverance initially. Um, I want to ask a question. Maybe I'll switch it on. So, so I I think this is switch it on.

So, so I I think this is one aspect that I'm quite proud about is one aspect that I'm quite proud about is one aspect that I'm quite proud about is that we scholars one of the key goals is that we scholars one of the key goals is that we scholars one of the key goals is to still publish.

We've seen this to still publish. We've seen this closing down of publishing in industry closing down of publishing in industry labs. I guess there's why is that trend labs.

I guess there's why is that trend happening and you know why is it so happening and you know why is it so happening and you know why is it so important that we still have programs important that we still have programs that publish and release work.

that publish and release work.

&gt;&gt; Uh I think this this trend happens &gt;&gt; Uh I think this this trend happens &gt;&gt; Uh I think this this trend happens because of the the reality of AI now the because of the the reality of AI now the because of the the reality of AI now the fast adaption also comes with the fast adaption also comes with the financial outcome.

financial outcome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And like there's a huge &gt;&gt; Yeah.

And like there's a huge competition because of the same reason competition because of the same reason because of the financial outcome that because of the financial outcome that leads AI labs to publish less. The one leads AI labs to publish less.

The one thing that is sort of missing in this uh thing that is sort of missing in this uh thing that is sort of missing in this uh formulation is like when we publish less formulation is like when we publish less then this adaption and this pace will then this adaption and this pace will eventually slow down.

So to keep this eventually slow down.

So to keep this pace same or even go beyond we have to pace same or even go beyond we have to pace same or even go beyond we have to do research we have to do open science do research we have to do open science do research we have to do open science and we have to publish.

That's why I and we have to publish.

That's why I feel super lucky that as a lab we really feel super lucky that as a lab we really feel super lucky that as a lab we really publish not only publish with the stuff publish not only publish with the stuff but also really open up entry points for but also really open up entry points for but also really open up entry points for junior researcher new superstars.

I junior researcher new superstars.

I think this is because this really kind think this is because this really kind of two-way thing as we publish more we of two-way thing as we publish more we of two-way thing as we publish more we have this open up entry points when we have this open up entry points when we have this open up entry points when we have more entry points when we lots of have more entry points when we lots of have more entry points when we lots of new junior researchers then we actually new junior researchers then we actually publish better.

So I think that's uh publish better. So I think that's uh yeah that's what I think about that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So if you come to our events, &gt;&gt; Yeah.

So if you come to our events, we'll actually share what we're working we'll actually share what we're working on. Um but this was very nice, amazing.

I think the scholars program is one of I think the scholars program is one of I think the scholars program is one of the pillars of how we innovate and how the pillars of how we innovate and how the pillars of how we innovate and how we work on the next generation models.

we work on the next generation models. So thanks everyone for sharing your So thanks everyone for sharing your perspective. So Ahmed and Moisia and perspective.

So Ahmed and Moisia and John often often mentoring the scholars John often often mentoring the scholars projects and John joined us from the projects and John joined us from the scholars program. So it's really nice to scholars program.

So it's really nice to have your perspective as people think have your perspective as people think about this.
