I want to highlight our open science

**‚è∞ 00:04:57**
I want to highlight our open science initiative in particular. So I think

many of you are probably part of our community. It has been growing a lot

**‚è∞ 00:05:04**
community. It has been growing a lot

**‚è∞ 00:05:04**
community. It has been growing a lot since we started in uh mid22. Um now

**‚è∞ 00:05:09**
since we started in uh mid22. Um now

**‚è∞ 00:05:23**
collaborations throughout the year uh to

**‚è∞ 00:05:23**
collaborations throughout the year uh to work with people in our community. But

**‚è∞ 00:05:25**
work with people in our community. But

**‚è∞ 00:05:25**
work with people in our community. But also the community is great because they

**‚è∞ 00:05:27**
also the community is great because they

**‚è∞ 00:05:27**
also the community is great because they also have have always been organizing uh

to help each other uh to learn and uh to

**‚è∞ 00:05:39**
to help each other uh to learn and uh to uh just it depends on their interest

**‚è∞ 00:05:41**
uh just it depends on their interest

**‚è∞ 00:05:42**
uh just it depends on their interest whether it's like for beginners to get

**‚è∞ 00:05:44**
whether it's like for beginners to get

**‚è∞ 00:05:44**
whether it's like for beginners to get into research whether there are

**‚è∞ 00:05:46**
into research whether there are

**‚è∞ 00:05:46**
into research whether there are particular u niches and uh interests

talks, organizing reading groups and also have been working together to

**‚è∞ 00:06:00**
also have been working together to

**‚è∞ 00:06:00**
also have been working together to publish papers. So, it's really great if

**‚è∞ 00:06:03**
publish papers. So, it's really great if

**‚è∞ 00:06:03**
publish papers. So, it's really great if you are looking for finding people who

**‚è∞ 00:06:06**
you are looking for finding people who

**‚è∞ 00:06:06**
you are looking for finding people who would share your interest in research or

**‚è∞ 00:06:09**
would share your interest in research or

**‚è∞ 00:06:09**
would share your interest in research or you are looking for where to start if

**‚è∞ 00:06:11**
you are looking for where to start if

**‚è∞ 00:06:11**
you are looking for where to start if you want to get to research. I would

**‚è∞ 00:06:12**
you want to get to research. I would

**‚è∞ 00:06:12**
you want to get to research. I would also recommend joining our uh open

**‚è∞ 00:06:15**
also recommend joining our uh open

**‚è∞ 00:06:15**
also recommend joining our uh open science community. But now, let's get to

**‚è∞ 00:06:18**
science community. But now, let's get to

**‚è∞ 00:06:18**
science community. But now, let's get to the scholar program. So I think the

**‚è∞ 00:06:20**
the scholar program. So I think the

**‚è∞ 00:06:20**
the scholar program. So I think the reason many of you are here today. So

**‚è∞ 00:06:24**
reason many of you are here today. So

**‚è∞ 00:06:24**
reason many of you are here today. So what is our scholar program? Uh and why

**‚è∞ 00:06:27**
what is our scholar program? Uh and why

**‚è∞ 00:06:27**
what is our scholar program? Uh and why are we really committed to this for the

**‚è∞ 00:06:30**
are we really committed to this for the

**‚è∞ 00:06:30**
are we really committed to this for the fourth year in a row? As you know uh the

**‚è∞ 00:06:34**
fourth year in a row? As you know uh the

**‚è∞ 00:06:34**
fourth year in a row? As you know uh the progress in our field in the machine

**‚è∞ 00:06:36**
progress in our field in the machine

**‚è∞ 00:06:36**
progress in our field in the machine learning field is quite fast and it's

**‚è∞ 00:06:40**
learning field is quite fast and it's

**‚è∞ 00:06:40**
learning field is quite fast and it's also becoming more and more difficult

**‚è∞ 00:06:43**
also becoming more and more difficult

**‚è∞ 00:06:43**
also becoming more and more difficult for people who wants to start and wants

**‚è∞ 00:06:46**
for people who wants to start and wants

**‚è∞ 00:06:46**
for people who wants to start and wants to get involved in especially in

**‚è∞ 00:06:48**
to get involved in especially in

**‚è∞ 00:06:48**
to get involved in especially in research which means working on cutting

**‚è∞ 00:06:50**
research which means working on cutting

**‚è∞ 00:06:50**
research which means working on cutting edge uh unexplored problems to to get

**‚è∞ 00:06:53**
edge uh unexplored problems to to get

**‚è∞ 00:06:53**
edge uh unexplored problems to to get involved because the main reason is that

**‚è∞ 00:06:55**
involved because the main reason is that

**‚è∞ 00:06:55**
involved because the main reason is that you need access to large uh large scale

**‚è∞ 00:06:59**
you need access to large uh large scale

**‚è∞ 00:06:59**
you need access to large uh large scale experiment setup and that is not

**‚è∞ 00:07:01**
experiment setup and that is not

**‚è∞ 00:07:01**
experiment setup and that is not something that is really unfortunately

**‚è∞ 00:07:04**
something that is really unfortunately

**‚è∞ 00:07:04**
something that is really unfortunately available everywhere. And our goal for

**‚è∞ 00:07:07**
available everywhere. And our goal for

**‚è∞ 00:07:07**
available everywhere. And our goal for this program is to provide the tools and

**‚è∞ 00:07:12**
this program is to provide the tools and

**‚è∞ 00:07:12**
this program is to provide the tools and the mentorship and uh the path

**‚è∞ 00:07:15**
the mentorship and uh the path

**‚è∞ 00:07:15**
the mentorship and uh the path essentially for those of you who really

**‚è∞ 00:07:19**
essentially for those of you who really

**‚è∞ 00:07:19**
essentially for those of you who really want to get started who wants to get

**‚è∞ 00:07:21**
want to get started who wants to get

**‚è∞ 00:07:21**
want to get started who wants to get into research and uh go throughout this

**‚è∞ 00:07:24**
into research and uh go throughout this

**‚è∞ 00:07:24**
into research and uh go throughout this research journey together with you. So

**‚è∞ 00:07:27**
research journey together with you. So

**‚è∞ 00:07:27**
research journey together with you. So we are running currently our 2025

**‚è∞ 00:07:29**
we are running currently our 2025

**‚è∞ 00:07:30**
we are running currently our 2025 research pro uh scholar program. So

**‚è∞ 00:07:32**
research pro uh scholar program. So

**‚è∞ 00:07:32**
research pro uh scholar program. So these are our six scholars. Two of them

**‚è∞ 00:07:34**
these are our six scholars. Two of them

**‚è∞ 00:07:34**
these are our six scholars. Two of them are here today which we uh uh we can

**‚è∞ 00:07:38**
are here today which we uh uh we can

**‚è∞ 00:07:38**
are here today which we uh uh we can talk to them later. Uh and uh actually

**‚è∞ 00:07:41**
talk to them later. Uh and uh actually

**‚è∞ 00:07:41**
talk to them later. Uh and uh actually some of them have already also published

**‚è∞ 00:07:43**
some of them have already also published

**‚è∞ 00:07:43**
some of them have already also published their work uh that they have been

**‚è∞ 00:07:44**
their work uh that they have been

**‚è∞ 00:07:44**
their work uh that they have been working uh for the past couple of

**‚è∞ 00:07:46**
working uh for the past couple of

**‚è∞ 00:07:46**
working uh for the past couple of months. Some of them are still uh

**‚è∞ 00:07:49**
months. Some of them are still uh

**‚è∞ 00:07:49**
months. Some of them are still uh working on their projects to wrap up to

**‚è∞ 00:07:51**
working on their projects to wrap up to

**‚è∞ 00:07:51**
working on their projects to wrap up to publish their work. uh and the uh the

**‚è∞ 00:07:55**
publish their work. uh and the uh the

**‚è∞ 00:07:55**
publish their work. uh and the uh the scholars have a big support from the uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:00**
scholars have a big support from the uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:00**
scholars have a big support from the uh different mentors across the company. So

**‚è∞ 00:08:03**
different mentors across the company. So

**‚è∞ 00:08:03**
different mentors across the company. So both from Coher Labs and also Cohier

**‚è∞ 00:08:05**
both from Coher Labs and also Cohier

**‚è∞ 00:08:05**
both from Coher Labs and also Cohier depending on each project. Uh so they're

**‚è∞ 00:08:07**
depending on each project. Uh so they're

**‚è∞ 00:08:07**
depending on each project. Uh so they're not really alone in uh working on these

**‚è∞ 00:08:11**
not really alone in uh working on these

**‚è∞ 00:08:11**
not really alone in uh working on these projects. Um and we provide a strong

**‚è∞ 00:08:14**
projects. Um and we provide a strong

**‚è∞ 00:08:14**
projects. Um and we provide a strong group of mentors uh for for the scholars

**‚è∞ 00:08:17**
group of mentors uh for for the scholars

**‚è∞ 00:08:17**
group of mentors uh for for the scholars throughout the program. And you might be

**‚è∞ 00:08:20**
throughout the program. And you might be

**‚è∞ 00:08:20**
throughout the program. And you might be asking okay what type of projects are

**‚è∞ 00:08:22**
asking okay what type of projects are

**‚è∞ 00:08:22**
asking okay what type of projects are you working on in this uh program? And

**‚è∞ 00:08:25**
you working on in this uh program? And

**‚è∞ 00:08:25**
you working on in this uh program? And here I wanted to highlight a few uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:27**
here I wanted to highlight a few uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:27**
here I wanted to highlight a few uh papers that we've published uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:29**
papers that we've published uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:29**
papers that we've published uh throughout the years. So this one uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:32**
throughout the years. So this one uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:32**
throughout the years. So this one uh Louisa from uh uh the program two years

**‚è∞ 00:08:35**
Louisa from uh uh the program two years

**‚è∞ 00:08:35**
Louisa from uh uh the program two years ago she uh in this particular work she

**‚è∞ 00:08:39**
ago she uh in this particular work she

**‚è∞ 00:08:39**
ago she uh in this particular work she uh worked on uh toxicity mitigation

**‚è∞ 00:08:41**
uh worked on uh toxicity mitigation

**‚è∞ 00:08:41**
uh worked on uh toxicity mitigation which uh in a multilingual setting which

**‚è∞ 00:08:43**
which uh in a multilingual setting which

**‚è∞ 00:08:43**
which uh in a multilingual setting which is really challenging and uh she she did

**‚è∞ 00:08:47**
is really challenging and uh she she did

**‚è∞ 00:08:48**
is really challenging and uh she she did an excellent job of uh publishing a

**‚è∞ 00:08:50**
an excellent job of uh publishing a

**‚è∞ 00:08:50**
an excellent job of uh publishing a really nice uh paper on this. uh last

**‚è∞ 00:08:53**
really nice uh paper on this. uh last

**‚è∞ 00:08:53**
really nice uh paper on this. uh last year worked on uh synthetic data for uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:59**
year worked on uh synthetic data for uh

**‚è∞ 00:08:59**
year worked on uh synthetic data for uh multilingual models. So in particular

**‚è∞ 00:09:02**
multilingual models. So in particular

**‚è∞ 00:09:02**
multilingual models. So in particular coming up with a new method of uh what

**‚è∞ 00:09:04**
coming up with a new method of uh what

**‚è∞ 00:09:04**
coming up with a new method of uh what we call multilingual arbitrage to uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:07**
we call multilingual arbitrage to uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:08**
we call multilingual arbitrage to uh expand the pool of data available to

**‚è∞ 00:09:10**
expand the pool of data available to

**‚è∞ 00:09:10**
expand the pool of data available to train models for different languages

**‚è∞ 00:09:12**
train models for different languages

**‚è∞ 00:09:12**
train models for different languages using multiple teachers. So really

**‚è∞ 00:09:14**
using multiple teachers. So really

**‚è∞ 00:09:14**
using multiple teachers. So really impactful work and uh which has been

**‚è∞ 00:09:18**
impactful work and uh which has been

**‚è∞ 00:09:18**
impactful work and uh which has been also since then used in different uh uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:22**
also since then used in different uh uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:22**
also since then used in different uh uh real world scenarios of developing

**‚è∞ 00:09:25**
real world scenarios of developing

**‚è∞ 00:09:25**
real world scenarios of developing models and releasing models. And then uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:28**
models and releasing models. And then uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:28**
models and releasing models. And then uh Louisa, another Louisa last year, she uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:32**
Louisa, another Louisa last year, she uh

**‚è∞ 00:09:32**
Louisa, another Louisa last year, she uh looked into how uh synthetic data can

**‚è∞ 00:09:35**
looked into how uh synthetic data can

**‚è∞ 00:09:35**
looked into how uh synthetic data can actually be a really uh fun way to

**‚è∞ 00:09:39**
actually be a really uh fun way to

**‚è∞ 00:09:39**
actually be a really uh fun way to target non-ifferiable objectives and

**‚è∞ 00:09:41**
target non-ifferiable objectives and

**‚è∞ 00:09:41**
target non-ifferiable objectives and steer model generations towards and when

**‚è∞ 00:09:44**
steer model generations towards and when

**‚è∞ 00:09:44**
steer model generations towards and when we talk about non-ifferiable objectives

**‚è∞ 00:09:46**
we talk about non-ifferiable objectives

**‚è∞ 00:09:46**
we talk about non-ifferiable objectives for instance uh you can think about

**‚è∞ 00:09:48**
for instance uh you can think about

**‚è∞ 00:09:48**
for instance uh you can think about maybe the length of the generation or

**‚è∞ 00:09:50**
maybe the length of the generation or

**‚è∞ 00:09:50**
maybe the length of the generation or like the tone uh things that are um you

**‚è∞ 00:09:53**
like the tone uh things that are um you

**‚è∞ 00:09:53**
like the tone uh things that are um you either have to deal with at preference

**‚è∞ 00:09:55**
either have to deal with at preference

**‚è∞ 00:09:56**
either have to deal with at preference training but in this particular project

**‚è∞ 00:09:57**
training but in this particular project

**‚è∞ 00:09:57**
training but in this particular project we looked into how to deal with that at

**‚è∞ 00:09:59**
we looked into how to deal with that at

**‚è∞ 00:09:59**
we looked into how to deal with that at SFD phase. Uh so yeah just a few works

**‚è∞ 00:10:02**
SFD phase. Uh so yeah just a few works

**‚è∞ 00:10:02**
SFD phase. Uh so yeah just a few works to show the types of projects that we

**‚è∞ 00:10:05**
to show the types of projects that we

**‚è∞ 00:10:05**
to show the types of projects that we work on but definitely if you are

**‚è∞ 00:10:07**
work on but definitely if you are

**‚è∞ 00:10:07**
work on but definitely if you are curious check out uh the the papers for

**‚è∞ 00:10:11**
curious check out uh the the papers for

**‚è∞ 00:10:11**
curious check out uh the the papers for uh the the previous years of the scholar

**‚è∞ 00:10:13**
uh the the previous years of the scholar

**‚è∞ 00:10:13**
uh the the previous years of the scholar program on our website and I do want to

**‚è∞ 00:10:16**
program on our website and I do want to

**‚è∞ 00:10:16**
program on our website and I do want to highlight that uh this is a remote first

**‚è∞ 00:10:19**
highlight that uh this is a remote first

**‚è∞ 00:10:19**
highlight that uh this is a remote first uh program and position. Our lab works

**‚è∞ 00:10:22**
uh program and position. Our lab works

**‚è∞ 00:10:22**
uh program and position. Our lab works remotely which I think is really

**‚è∞ 00:10:25**
remotely which I think is really

**‚è∞ 00:10:25**
remotely which I think is really important because we believe that talent

**‚è∞ 00:10:28**
important because we believe that talent

**‚è∞ 00:10:28**
important because we believe that talent can come from anywhere and we are really

**‚è∞ 00:10:30**
can come from anywhere and we are really

**‚è∞ 00:10:30**
can come from anywhere and we are really committed to find and work with people

**‚è∞ 00:10:32**
committed to find and work with people

**‚è∞ 00:10:32**
committed to find and work with people from across the world but we also have

**‚è∞ 00:10:35**
from across the world but we also have

**‚è∞ 00:10:35**
from across the world but we also have nice opportunities during this program

**‚è∞ 00:10:37**
nice opportunities during this program

**‚è∞ 00:10:37**
nice opportunities during this program to get together. I think this is a

**‚è∞ 00:10:40**
to get together. I think this is a

**‚è∞ 00:10:40**
to get together. I think this is a really nice uh chance because a lot of

**‚è∞ 00:10:43**
really nice uh chance because a lot of

**‚è∞ 00:10:43**
really nice uh chance because a lot of times the scholars are uh quite junior

**‚è∞ 00:10:46**
times the scholars are uh quite junior

**‚è∞ 00:10:46**
times the scholars are uh quite junior and they can practice their presentation

**‚è∞ 00:10:49**
and they can practice their presentation

**‚è∞ 00:10:49**
and they can practice their presentation skills um in person when we meet for

**‚è∞ 00:10:52**
skills um in person when we meet for

**‚è∞ 00:10:52**
skills um in person when we meet for instance uh in one of our um office

**‚è∞ 00:10:55**
instance uh in one of our um office

**‚è∞ 00:10:55**
instance uh in one of our um office sites or uh just like uh somewhere in

**‚è∞ 00:10:59**
sites or uh just like uh somewhere in

**‚è∞ 00:10:59**
sites or uh just like uh somewhere in the board essentially and they they

**‚è∞ 00:11:01**
the board essentially and they they

**‚è∞ 00:11:01**
the board essentially and they they present their work whether in progress

**‚è∞ 00:11:03**
present their work whether in progress

**‚è∞ 00:11:03**
present their work whether in progress or done to the rest of the company which

**‚è∞ 00:11:06**
or done to the rest of the company which

**‚è∞ 00:11:06**
or done to the rest of the company which is quite nice. So as part of this

**‚è∞ 00:11:08**
is quite nice. So as part of this

**‚è∞ 00:11:08**
is quite nice. So as part of this program there's also this opportunity

**‚è∞ 00:11:10**
program there's also this opportunity

**‚è∞ 00:11:10**
program there's also this opportunity that we can uh still also meet in person

**‚è∞ 00:11:14**
that we can uh still also meet in person

**‚è∞ 00:11:14**
that we can uh still also meet in person and this would be the start of the

**‚è∞ 00:11:17**
and this would be the start of the

**‚è∞ 00:11:17**
and this would be the start of the journey of a researcher and uh

**‚è∞ 00:11:20**
journey of a researcher and uh

**‚è∞ 00:11:20**
journey of a researcher and uh definitely not the end. Uh past scholars

**‚è∞ 00:11:24**
definitely not the end. Uh past scholars

**‚è∞ 00:11:24**
definitely not the end. Uh past scholars have ended up uh going at different

**‚è∞ 00:11:27**
have ended up uh going at different

**‚è∞ 00:11:27**
have ended up uh going at different universities to do their PhDs or uh

**‚è∞ 00:11:31**
universities to do their PhDs or uh

**‚è∞ 00:11:31**
universities to do their PhDs or uh joining different uh companies to

**‚è∞ 00:11:33**
joining different uh companies to

**‚è∞ 00:11:33**
joining different uh companies to continue working on this technology. And

**‚è∞ 00:11:36**
continue working on this technology. And

**‚è∞ 00:11:36**
continue working on this technology. And uh our hope is to provide this

**‚è∞ 00:11:38**
uh our hope is to provide this

**‚è∞ 00:11:38**
uh our hope is to provide this opportunity and this path to to the next

**‚è∞ 00:11:41**
opportunity and this path to to the next

**‚è∞ 00:11:41**
opportunity and this path to to the next uh round of scholars. Uh here are some

**‚è∞ 00:11:46**
uh round of scholars. Uh here are some

**‚è∞ 00:11:46**
uh round of scholars. Uh here are some more details about uh like exactly what

**‚è∞ 00:11:50**
more details about uh like exactly what

**‚è∞ 00:11:50**
more details about uh like exactly what the program for next year look like. I

**‚è∞ 00:11:52**
the program for next year look like. I

**‚è∞ 00:11:52**
the program for next year look like. I think Britany do you want to take over

**‚è∞ 00:11:56**
think Britany do you want to take over

**‚è∞ 00:11:56**
think Britany do you want to take over or shall I maybe go through these as

**‚è∞ 00:11:58**
or shall I maybe go through these as

**‚è∞ 00:11:58**
or shall I maybe go through these as well?

**‚è∞ 00:11:59**
well?

**‚è∞ 00:11:59**
well? &gt;&gt; Um I think I'll have you go through

&gt;&gt; Um I think I'll have you go through

**‚è∞ 00:12:01**
&gt;&gt; Um I think I'll have you go through these and then I'll jump in once we talk

**‚è∞ 00:12:02**
these and then I'll jump in once we talk

**‚è∞ 00:12:02**
these and then I'll jump in once we talk about the application if that's okay.

**‚è∞ 00:12:04**
about the application if that's okay.

**‚è∞ 00:12:04**
about the application if that's okay. Yeah. Uh nice. Yeah, definitely. So,

**‚è∞ 00:12:07**
Yeah. Uh nice. Yeah, definitely. So,

**‚è∞ 00:12:14**
position, remote first paid opportunity.

**‚è∞ 00:12:14**
position, remote first paid opportunity. Uh the the plan is to have an

**‚è∞ 00:12:16**
Uh the the plan is to have an

**‚è∞ 00:12:16**
Uh the the plan is to have an eight-month uh program starting mid

**‚è∞ 00:12:19**
eight-month uh program starting mid

**‚è∞ 00:12:19**
eight-month uh program starting mid January next year. And as I mentioned,

**‚è∞ 00:12:22**
January next year. And as I mentioned,

**‚è∞ 00:12:22**
January next year. And as I mentioned, we support uh the scholars by providing

**‚è∞ 00:12:26**
we support uh the scholars by providing

**‚è∞ 00:12:26**
we support uh the scholars by providing uh uh an in-house mentorship and

**‚è∞ 00:12:29**
uh uh an in-house mentorship and

**‚è∞ 00:12:29**
uh uh an in-house mentorship and research team and also uh dedicated

**‚è∞ 00:12:32**

**‚è∞ 00:12:41**
throughout the uh the eight months that

**‚è∞ 00:12:41**
throughout the uh the eight months that they worked with us. And really the uh

**‚è∞ 00:12:46**
they worked with us. And really the uh

**‚è∞ 00:12:46**
they worked with us. And really the uh what you uh what would be like the best

**‚è∞ 00:12:49**
what you uh what would be like the best

**‚è∞ 00:12:49**
what you uh what would be like the best way to think about this program is and

**‚è∞ 00:12:52**
way to think about this program is and

**‚è∞ 00:12:52**
way to think about this program is and to prepare for it is that it's going to

**‚è∞ 00:12:54**
to prepare for it is that it's going to

**‚è∞ 00:12:54**
to prepare for it is that it's going to be intense. It's going to be really

**‚è∞ 00:12:56**
be intense. It's going to be really

**‚è∞ 00:12:56**
be intense. It's going to be really hard. We are working on difficult open

**‚è∞ 00:12:58**
hard. We are working on difficult open

**‚è∞ 00:12:58**
hard. We are working on difficult open problems that are not solved but it's

**‚è∞ 00:13:01**
problems that are not solved but it's

**‚è∞ 00:13:01**
problems that are not solved but it's also going to be very rewarding if you

**‚è∞ 00:13:03**
also going to be very rewarding if you

**‚è∞ 00:13:03**
also going to be very rewarding if you are willing to take that chance and take

**‚è∞ 00:13:05**
are willing to take that chance and take

**‚è∞ 00:13:05**
are willing to take that chance and take that commitment. So uh yeah

**‚è∞ 00:13:11**
and uh I do want to highlight that this

**‚è∞ 00:13:16**
and uh I do want to highlight that this

**‚è∞ 00:13:16**
and uh I do want to highlight that this program is a little bit different and

**‚è∞ 00:13:18**
program is a little bit different and

**‚è∞ 00:13:18**
program is a little bit different and special because we are in particular

**‚è∞ 00:13:21**
special because we are in particular

**‚è∞ 00:13:21**
special because we are in particular looking for emerging talent and what

**‚è∞ 00:13:23**
looking for emerging talent and what

**‚è∞ 00:13:23**
looking for emerging talent and what this means that you can be an early

**‚è∞ 00:13:25**
this means that you can be an early

**‚è∞ 00:13:25**
this means that you can be an early career researcher. You don't necessarily

**‚è∞ 00:13:28**
career researcher. You don't necessarily

**‚è∞ 00:13:28**
career researcher. You don't necessarily have to have a specific degree uh and

**‚è∞ 00:13:31**
have to have a specific degree uh and

**‚è∞ 00:13:31**
have to have a specific degree uh and also you don't have to have uh a

**‚è∞ 00:13:33**
also you don't have to have uh a

**‚è∞ 00:13:33**
also you don't have to have uh a published record before. So if you have

**‚è∞ 00:13:35**
published record before. So if you have

**‚è∞ 00:13:35**
published record before. So if you have published paper, it's okay. If you

**‚è∞ 00:13:37**
published paper, it's okay. If you

**‚è∞ 00:13:37**
published paper, it's okay. If you haven't, it might even be better because

**‚è∞ 00:13:39**
haven't, it might even be better because

**‚è∞ 00:13:39**
haven't, it might even be better because we really want to provide this

**‚è∞ 00:13:40**
we really want to provide this

**‚è∞ 00:13:40**
we really want to provide this opportunity to early career and junior

**‚è∞ 00:13:44**
opportunity to early career and junior

**‚è∞ 00:13:44**
opportunity to early career and junior researchers who have strong machine

**‚è∞ 00:13:46**
researchers who have strong machine

**‚è∞ 00:13:46**
researchers who have strong machine learning and engineering skills and want

**‚è∞ 00:13:49**
learning and engineering skills and want

**‚è∞ 00:13:49**
learning and engineering skills and want to get involved in uh research in AI.

**‚è∞ 00:13:54**
to get involved in uh research in AI.

**‚è∞ 00:13:54**
to get involved in uh research in AI. Uh nice. So the next section is about

**‚è∞ 00:13:56**
Uh nice. So the next section is about

**‚è∞ 00:13:56**
Uh nice. So the next section is about the application process and what to

**‚è∞ 00:13:59**
the application process and what to

**‚è∞ 00:13:59**
the application process and what to expect when you apply. So I think I'll

**‚è∞ 00:14:01**
expect when you apply. So I think I'll

**‚è∞ 00:14:01**
expect when you apply. So I think I'll hand off to Britany now.

**‚è∞ 00:14:03**
hand off to Britany now.

**‚è∞ 00:14:03**
hand off to Britany now. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Thanks so much Marzia. Um yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:14:06**
&gt;&gt; Perfect. Thanks so much Marzia. Um yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:14:06**
&gt;&gt; Perfect. Thanks so much Marzia. Um yeah, so I think let's zoom in a bit and talk

**‚è∞ 00:14:08**
so I think let's zoom in a bit and talk

**‚è∞ 00:14:08**
so I think let's zoom in a bit and talk about the application to the scholars

**‚è∞ 00:14:10**
about the application to the scholars

**‚è∞ 00:14:10**
about the application to the scholars program. So there are three stages in

**‚è∞ 00:14:13**
program. So there are three stages in

**‚è∞ 00:14:13**
program. So there are three stages in the application process. We are

**‚è∞ 00:14:14**
the application process. We are

**‚è∞ 00:14:14**
the application process. We are currently in stage one where we're

**‚è∞ 00:14:16**
currently in stage one where we're

**‚è∞ 00:14:16**
currently in stage one where we're accepting applications include and with

**‚è∞ 00:14:19**
accepting applications include and with

**‚è∞ 00:14:19**
accepting applications include and with the application we'll ask you for a

**‚è∞ 00:14:20**
the application we'll ask you for a

**‚è∞ 00:14:20**
the application we'll ask you for a personal statement and a video

**‚è∞ 00:14:21**
personal statement and a video

**‚è∞ 00:14:21**
personal statement and a video submission. So we'll start by digging

**‚è∞ 00:14:24**
submission. So we'll start by digging

**‚è∞ 00:14:24**
submission. So we'll start by digging into stage one a bit. Um so as you've

**‚è∞ 00:14:27**
into stage one a bit. Um so as you've

**‚è∞ 00:14:27**
into stage one a bit. Um so as you've seen if you've clicked on the link um

**‚è∞ 00:14:29**
seen if you've clicked on the link um

**‚è∞ 00:14:29**
seen if you've clicked on the link um you've seen the application it looks

**‚è∞ 00:14:30**
you've seen the application it looks

**‚è∞ 00:14:30**
you've seen the application it looks like this. And again, this will ask you

**‚è∞ 00:14:32**
like this. And again, this will ask you

**‚è∞ 00:14:32**
like this. And again, this will ask you when you're submitting your application,

**‚è∞ 00:14:34**
when you're submitting your application,

**‚è∞ 00:14:34**
when you're submitting your application, it will ask you for both a personal

**‚è∞ 00:14:35**
it will ask you for both a personal

**‚è∞ 00:14:35**
it will ask you for both a personal statement and um a video submission. So,

**‚è∞ 00:14:37**
statement and um a video submission. So,

**‚è∞ 00:14:37**
statement and um a video submission. So, we'll talk briefly about both of those

**‚è∞ 00:14:39**
we'll talk briefly about both of those

**‚è∞ 00:14:40**
we'll talk briefly about both of those um elements of the application. Now, so

**‚è∞ 00:14:42**
um elements of the application. Now, so

**‚è∞ 00:14:42**
um elements of the application. Now, so the first thing um we'll talk about the

**‚è∞ 00:14:44**
the first thing um we'll talk about the

**‚è∞ 00:14:44**
the first thing um we'll talk about the personal statement. So, the personal

**‚è∞ 00:14:46**
personal statement. So, the personal

**‚è∞ 00:14:46**
personal statement. So, the personal statement is really an opportunity for

**‚è∞ 00:14:47**
statement is really an opportunity for

**‚è∞ 00:14:47**
statement is really an opportunity for you to let us know who you are and what

**‚è∞ 00:14:49**
you to let us know who you are and what

**‚è∞ 00:14:49**
you to let us know who you are and what your research goals are. Um, what we're

**‚è∞ 00:14:52**
your research goals are. Um, what we're

**‚è∞ 00:14:52**
your research goals are. Um, what we're looking for here is ones that stand out

**‚è∞ 00:14:54**
looking for here is ones that stand out

**‚è∞ 00:14:54**
looking for here is ones that stand out and ones that talk about specific

**‚è∞ 00:14:56**
and ones that talk about specific

**‚è∞ 00:14:56**
and ones that talk about specific moments or specific experiences that are

**‚è∞ 00:14:58**
moments or specific experiences that are

**‚è∞ 00:14:58**
moments or specific experiences that are helpful for us to understand your

**‚è∞ 00:15:00**
helpful for us to understand your

**‚è∞ 00:15:00**
helpful for us to understand your strengths and why this program would be

**‚è∞ 00:15:03**
strengths and why this program would be

**‚è∞ 00:15:03**
strengths and why this program would be a good fit for you. Um, so just be sure

**‚è∞ 00:15:05**
a good fit for you. Um, so just be sure

**‚è∞ 00:15:05**
a good fit for you. Um, so just be sure to tailor this to this opportunity and

**‚è∞ 00:15:08**
to tailor this to this opportunity and

**‚è∞ 00:15:08**
to tailor this to this opportunity and um, yeah, I think you want to give it

**‚è∞ 00:15:10**
um, yeah, I think you want to give it

**‚è∞ 00:15:10**
um, yeah, I think you want to give it some time to revise. Um, revisit it,

**‚è∞ 00:15:12**
some time to revise. Um, revisit it,

**‚è∞ 00:15:12**
some time to revise. Um, revisit it, maybe draft it, take a couple hours off,

**‚è∞ 00:15:15**
maybe draft it, take a couple hours off,

**‚è∞ 00:15:15**
maybe draft it, take a couple hours off, couple days off, come back and then we

**‚è∞ 00:15:17**
couple days off, come back and then we

**‚è∞ 00:15:17**
couple days off, come back and then we also recommend proofreading this. Um,

**‚è∞ 00:15:18**
also recommend proofreading this. Um,

**‚è∞ 00:15:18**
also recommend proofreading this. Um, ask a friend. So, a second opinion could

**‚è∞ 00:15:21**
ask a friend. So, a second opinion could

**‚è∞ 00:15:21**
ask a friend. So, a second opinion could really help you get some call out areas

**‚è∞ 00:15:23**
really help you get some call out areas

**‚è∞ 00:15:23**
really help you get some call out areas where things are maybe unclear or maybe

**‚è∞ 00:15:25**
where things are maybe unclear or maybe

**‚è∞ 00:15:25**
where things are maybe unclear or maybe you should add another example to help

**‚è∞ 00:15:27**
you should add another example to help

**‚è∞ 00:15:27**
you should add another example to help sort of um make your point more clear.

**‚è∞ 00:15:30**
sort of um make your point more clear.

**‚è∞ 00:15:30**
sort of um make your point more clear. And then lastly, I think sort of hear

**‚è∞ 00:15:31**
And then lastly, I think sort of hear

**‚è∞ 00:15:31**
And then lastly, I think sort of hear how it reads. Read it out loud. U maybe

**‚è∞ 00:15:33**
how it reads. Read it out loud. U maybe

**‚è∞ 00:15:34**
how it reads. Read it out loud. U maybe read it to a friend, send it to your

**‚è∞ 00:15:35**
read it to a friend, send it to your

**‚è∞ 00:15:35**
read it to a friend, send it to your grandma, I don't know, have someone else

**‚è∞ 00:15:37**
grandma, I don't know, have someone else

**‚è∞ 00:15:37**
grandma, I don't know, have someone else listen to it. And um I think having

**‚è∞ 00:15:39**
listen to it. And um I think having

**‚è∞ 00:15:39**
listen to it. And um I think having someone else um review it just kind of

**‚è∞ 00:15:41**
someone else um review it just kind of

**‚è∞ 00:15:41**
someone else um review it just kind of helps you get another perspective and

**‚è∞ 00:15:43**
helps you get another perspective and

**‚è∞ 00:15:44**
helps you get another perspective and maybe that person can help point things

**‚è∞ 00:15:45**
maybe that person can help point things

**‚è∞ 00:15:45**
maybe that person can help point things out that are missing or maybe something

**‚è∞ 00:15:47**
out that are missing or maybe something

**‚è∞ 00:15:47**
out that are missing or maybe something sounds awkward or you know maybe some

**‚è∞ 00:15:49**
sounds awkward or you know maybe some

**‚è∞ 00:15:49**
sounds awkward or you know maybe some information is missing.

**‚è∞ 00:15:51**
information is missing.

**‚è∞ 00:15:51**
information is missing. Um if we could go to the next slide. So

**‚è∞ 00:15:53**
Um if we could go to the next slide. So

**‚è∞ 00:15:53**
Um if we could go to the next slide. So we do have an example here. I won't read

**‚è∞ 00:15:55**
we do have an example here. I won't read

**‚è∞ 00:15:55**
we do have an example here. I won't read this example but we do have an example

**‚è∞ 00:15:57**
this example but we do have an example

**‚è∞ 00:15:57**
this example but we do have an example here of a personal statement. And we

**‚è∞ 00:15:59**
here of a personal statement. And we

**‚è∞ 00:15:59**
here of a personal statement. And we also have this available on our notion

**‚è∞ 00:16:01**
also have this available on our notion

**‚è∞ 00:16:01**
also have this available on our notion guide. So we'll drop a link to that in

**‚è∞ 00:16:03**
guide. So we'll drop a link to that in

**‚è∞ 00:16:03**
guide. So we'll drop a link to that in the chat. Um, but this is a personal

**‚è∞ 00:16:06**
the chat. Um, but this is a personal

**‚è∞ 00:16:06**
the chat. Um, but this is a personal statement we have for somebody that was

**‚è∞ 00:16:07**
statement we have for somebody that was

**‚è∞ 00:16:07**
statement we have for somebody that was applying to a PhD program. So, it is

**‚è∞ 00:16:10**
applying to a PhD program. So, it is

**‚è∞ 00:16:10**
applying to a PhD program. So, it is slightly different, right? This isn't a

**‚è∞ 00:16:11**
slightly different, right? This isn't a

**‚è∞ 00:16:11**
slightly different, right? This isn't a PhD program, but I think the next slide

**‚è∞ 00:16:13**
PhD program, but I think the next slide

**‚è∞ 00:16:13**
PhD program, but I think the next slide kind of talks about um yeah, so why why

**‚è∞ 00:16:17**
kind of talks about um yeah, so why why

**‚è∞ 00:16:17**
kind of talks about um yeah, so why why does that statement work? Well, even

**‚è∞ 00:16:18**
does that statement work? Well, even

**‚è∞ 00:16:18**
does that statement work? Well, even though it's not for our program

**‚è∞ 00:16:19**
though it's not for our program

**‚è∞ 00:16:19**
though it's not for our program directly, it's for our PhD program, but

**‚è∞ 00:16:21**
directly, it's for our PhD program, but

**‚è∞ 00:16:21**
directly, it's for our PhD program, but it works because it's clear and direct

**‚è∞ 00:16:23**
it works because it's clear and direct

**‚è∞ 00:16:23**
it works because it's clear and direct and it's really specific um to her

**‚è∞ 00:16:26**
and it's really specific um to her

**‚è∞ 00:16:26**
and it's really specific um to her experience and what she wants to achieve

**‚è∞ 00:16:27**
experience and what she wants to achieve

**‚è∞ 00:16:28**
experience and what she wants to achieve and it's specific to the program. I

**‚è∞ 00:16:29**
and it's specific to the program. I

**‚è∞ 00:16:29**
and it's specific to the program. I think that that's another thing we want

**‚è∞ 00:16:31**
think that that's another thing we want

**‚è∞ 00:16:31**
think that that's another thing we want to highlight. I'm sure you all have

**‚è∞ 00:16:32**
to highlight. I'm sure you all have

**‚è∞ 00:16:32**
to highlight. I'm sure you all have dropped personal statements for other

**‚è∞ 00:16:34**
dropped personal statements for other

**‚è∞ 00:16:34**
dropped personal statements for other things, but we want to make sure that

**‚è∞ 00:16:35**
things, but we want to make sure that

**‚è∞ 00:16:35**
things, but we want to make sure that this is really tailored to this program

**‚è∞ 00:16:38**
this is really tailored to this program

**‚è∞ 00:16:38**
this is really tailored to this program specifically. Um the terms are also

**‚è∞ 00:16:41**
specifically. Um the terms are also

**‚è∞ 00:16:41**
specifically. Um the terms are also defined in that example and it really

**‚è∞ 00:16:43**
defined in that example and it really

**‚è∞ 00:16:43**
defined in that example and it really defines her research interests and shows

**‚è∞ 00:16:45**
defines her research interests and shows

**‚è∞ 00:16:45**
defines her research interests and shows a reason why why is she passionate about

**‚è∞ 00:16:48**
a reason why why is she passionate about

**‚è∞ 00:16:48**
a reason why why is she passionate about um her goals and what she wants to

**‚è∞ 00:16:49**
um her goals and what she wants to

**‚è∞ 00:16:49**
um her goals and what she wants to achieve. Um so yeah I think yeah this is

**‚è∞ 00:16:53**
achieve. Um so yeah I think yeah this is

**‚è∞ 00:16:53**
achieve. Um so yeah I think yeah this is a sn a quick snapshot of the research

**‚è∞ 00:16:55**
a sn a quick snapshot of the research

**‚è∞ 00:16:55**
a sn a quick snapshot of the research the personal statement guidelines that

**‚è∞ 00:16:57**
the personal statement guidelines that

**‚è∞ 00:16:57**
the personal statement guidelines that we have and so we'll share that link

**‚è∞ 00:16:59**
we have and so we'll share that link

**‚è∞ 00:16:59**
we have and so we'll share that link again in the chat but um you can check

**‚è∞ 00:17:02**
again in the chat but um you can check

**‚è∞ 00:17:02**
again in the chat but um you can check out that example there. I know you

**‚è∞ 00:17:04**
out that example there. I know you

**‚è∞ 00:17:04**
out that example there. I know you probably didn't have time to read that

**‚è∞ 00:17:05**
probably didn't have time to read that

**‚è∞ 00:17:05**
probably didn't have time to read that on that slide so yeah be sure to check

**‚è∞ 00:17:07**
on that slide so yeah be sure to check

**‚è∞ 00:17:07**
on that slide so yeah be sure to check that out. Um next let's talk about the

**‚è∞ 00:17:10**
that out. Um next let's talk about the

**‚è∞ 00:17:10**
that out. Um next let's talk about the video. I think this is a really big

**‚è∞ 00:17:11**
video. I think this is a really big

**‚è∞ 00:17:12**
video. I think this is a really big piece of the interview and it's a really

**‚è∞ 00:17:13**
piece of the interview and it's a really

**‚è∞ 00:17:13**
piece of the interview and it's a really important piece because we get to see

**‚è∞ 00:17:14**
important piece because we get to see

**‚è∞ 00:17:14**
important piece because we get to see you we get to see you face to face and

**‚è∞ 00:17:17**
you we get to see you face to face and

**‚è∞ 00:17:17**
you we get to see you face to face and kind of learn um you know a bit about

**‚è∞ 00:17:20**
kind of learn um you know a bit about

**‚è∞ 00:17:20**
kind of learn um you know a bit about sort of how you think in terms of

**‚è∞ 00:17:22**
sort of how you think in terms of

**‚è∞ 00:17:22**
sort of how you think in terms of research. So um this prompt is a little

**‚è∞ 00:17:24**
research. So um this prompt is a little

**‚è∞ 00:17:24**
research. So um this prompt is a little different this year. So if you're

**‚è∞ 00:17:25**
different this year. So if you're

**‚è∞ 00:17:26**
different this year. So if you're reapplying from last year it is a little

**‚è∞ 00:17:27**
reapplying from last year it is a little

**‚è∞ 00:17:27**
reapplying from last year it is a little different. So be sure to check out the

**‚è∞ 00:17:29**
different. So be sure to check out the

**‚è∞ 00:17:29**
different. So be sure to check out the prompt. We'll drop the link to that as

**‚è∞ 00:17:30**
prompt. We'll drop the link to that as

**‚è∞ 00:17:30**
prompt. We'll drop the link to that as well there. That's also on on the notion

**‚è∞ 00:17:32**
well there. That's also on on the notion

**‚è∞ 00:17:32**
well there. That's also on on the notion guide. But the prompt this year is we

**‚è∞ 00:17:34**
guide. But the prompt this year is we

**‚è∞ 00:17:34**
guide. But the prompt this year is we want you to choose a paper from the list

**‚è∞ 00:17:36**
want you to choose a paper from the list

**‚è∞ 00:17:36**
want you to choose a paper from the list provided. And again the list is on the

**‚è∞ 00:17:38**
provided. And again the list is on the

**‚è∞ 00:17:38**
provided. And again the list is on the notion page and talk about um and

**‚è∞ 00:17:41**
notion page and talk about um and

**‚è∞ 00:17:41**
notion page and talk about um and suggest different directions in which

**‚è∞ 00:17:43**
suggest different directions in which

**‚è∞ 00:17:43**
suggest different directions in which that work can be further expanded. So um

**‚è∞ 00:17:47**
that work can be further expanded. So um

**‚è∞ 00:17:47**
that work can be further expanded. So um maybe you want to start by start the

**‚è∞ 00:17:49**
maybe you want to start by start the

**‚è∞ 00:17:49**
maybe you want to start by start the video by quickly introducing yourself

**‚è∞ 00:17:51**
video by quickly introducing yourself

**‚è∞ 00:17:52**
video by quickly introducing yourself and start by saying which paper you

**‚è∞ 00:17:53**
and start by saying which paper you

**‚è∞ 00:17:53**
and start by saying which paper you chose and maybe why you chose it. Um

**‚è∞ 00:17:55**
chose and maybe why you chose it. Um

**‚è∞ 00:17:55**
chose and maybe why you chose it. Um maybe that's that's an area of interest

**‚è∞ 00:17:57**
maybe that's that's an area of interest

**‚è∞ 00:17:57**
maybe that's that's an area of interest for you and why is that an area of

**‚è∞ 00:17:59**
for you and why is that an area of

**‚è∞ 00:17:59**
for you and why is that an area of interest for you. And then I think you

**‚è∞ 00:18:01**
interest for you. And then I think you

**‚è∞ 00:18:01**
interest for you. And then I think you want to spend the majority of the time

**‚è∞ 00:18:03**
want to spend the majority of the time

**‚è∞ 00:18:04**
want to spend the majority of the time of this video talking about the prompt

**‚è∞ 00:18:05**
of this video talking about the prompt

**‚è∞ 00:18:06**
of this video talking about the prompt specifically. I think that that would be

**‚è∞ 00:18:07**
specifically. I think that that would be

**‚è∞ 00:18:07**
specifically. I think that that would be a really big tip from for us. Um video

**‚è∞ 00:18:09**
a really big tip from for us. Um video

**‚è∞ 00:18:09**
a really big tip from for us. Um video should be 5 minutes and so maybe take

**‚è∞ 00:18:12**
should be 5 minutes and so maybe take

**‚è∞ 00:18:12**
should be 5 minutes and so maybe take you know a couple seconds in the

**‚è∞ 00:18:13**
you know a couple seconds in the

**‚è∞ 00:18:13**
you know a couple seconds in the beginning to talk like I said introduce

**‚è∞ 00:18:15**
beginning to talk like I said introduce

**‚è∞ 00:18:15**
beginning to talk like I said introduce yourself which paper you chose. Um but

**‚è∞ 00:18:18**
yourself which paper you chose. Um but

**‚è∞ 00:18:18**
yourself which paper you chose. Um but yeah we really want you to spend a

**‚è∞ 00:18:19**
yeah we really want you to spend a

**‚è∞ 00:18:19**
yeah we really want you to spend a majority of time on the prompt. So the

**‚è∞ 00:18:21**
majority of time on the prompt. So the

**‚è∞ 00:18:21**
majority of time on the prompt. So the prompt being how can it be further

**‚è∞ 00:18:23**
prompt being how can it be further

**‚è∞ 00:18:23**
prompt being how can it be further expanded? How can this work? So we know

**‚è∞ 00:18:25**
expanded? How can this work? So we know

**‚è∞ 00:18:25**
expanded? How can this work? So we know what the paper is about, right? Our lab

**‚è∞ 00:18:26**
what the paper is about, right? Our lab

**‚è∞ 00:18:26**
what the paper is about, right? Our lab wrote the the list of papers and so

**‚è∞ 00:18:29**
wrote the the list of papers and so

**‚è∞ 00:18:29**
wrote the the list of papers and so we're not looking for you to come in and

**‚è∞ 00:18:31**
we're not looking for you to come in and

**‚è∞ 00:18:31**
we're not looking for you to come in and do a fiveminute overview of the paper.

**‚è∞ 00:18:33**
do a fiveminute overview of the paper.

**‚è∞ 00:18:33**
do a fiveminute overview of the paper. Um while that's really cool, that's not

**‚è∞ 00:18:35**
Um while that's really cool, that's not

**‚è∞ 00:18:35**
Um while that's really cool, that's not what we're looking for. or we know what

**‚è∞ 00:18:36**
what we're looking for. or we know what

**‚è∞ 00:18:36**
what we're looking for. or we know what the paper's about. We want you to kind

**‚è∞ 00:18:37**
the paper's about. We want you to kind

**‚è∞ 00:18:37**
the paper's about. We want you to kind of dig in and talk about how the work in

**‚è∞ 00:18:41**
of dig in and talk about how the work in

**‚è∞ 00:18:41**
of dig in and talk about how the work in the paper could be further expanded or

**‚è∞ 00:18:43**
the paper could be further expanded or

**‚è∞ 00:18:43**
the paper could be further expanded or um you know how can we build upon what

**‚è∞ 00:18:45**
um you know how can we build upon what

**‚è∞ 00:18:45**
um you know how can we build upon what we what we've you know what we've

**‚è∞ 00:18:47**
we what we've you know what we've

**‚è∞ 00:18:48**
we what we've you know what we've published here or how can we improve

**‚è∞ 00:18:50**
published here or how can we improve

**‚è∞ 00:18:50**
published here or how can we improve upon it um or dig further into it. So I

**‚è∞ 00:18:53**
upon it um or dig further into it. So I

**‚è∞ 00:18:53**
upon it um or dig further into it. So I would just recommend really spending

**‚è∞ 00:18:54**
would just recommend really spending

**‚è∞ 00:18:54**
would just recommend really spending your time it's only five minutes which

**‚è∞ 00:18:57**
your time it's only five minutes which

**‚è∞ 00:18:57**
your time it's only five minutes which is quick um spending your five minutes

**‚è∞ 00:18:59**
is quick um spending your five minutes

**‚è∞ 00:18:59**
is quick um spending your five minutes really digging into like how we can

**‚è∞ 00:19:01**
really digging into like how we can

**‚è∞ 00:19:01**
really digging into like how we can further expand on that. Um, we obviously

**‚è∞ 00:19:04**
further expand on that. Um, we obviously

**‚è∞ 00:19:04**
further expand on that. Um, we obviously recommend watching your video back,

**‚è∞ 00:19:05**
recommend watching your video back,

**‚è∞ 00:19:05**
recommend watching your video back, ensure the audio is clear. Um, another

**‚è∞ 00:19:08**
ensure the audio is clear. Um, another

**‚è∞ 00:19:08**
ensure the audio is clear. Um, another big thing is making sure the sharing

**‚è∞ 00:19:09**
big thing is making sure the sharing

**‚è∞ 00:19:09**
big thing is making sure the sharing settings on the link work. So, you can

**‚è∞ 00:19:11**
settings on the link work. So, you can

**‚è∞ 00:19:11**
settings on the link work. So, you can submit a video in any form. Google

**‚è∞ 00:19:13**
submit a video in any form. Google

**‚è∞ 00:19:13**
submit a video in any form. Google Drive, YouTube. I think a lot of people

**‚è∞ 00:19:15**
Drive, YouTube. I think a lot of people

**‚è∞ 00:19:15**
Drive, YouTube. I think a lot of people are using Loom I think it's called. Um,

**‚è∞ 00:19:18**
are using Loom I think it's called. Um,

**‚è∞ 00:19:18**
are using Loom I think it's called. Um, however you want to submit it, it's

**‚è∞ 00:19:19**
however you want to submit it, it's

**‚è∞ 00:19:19**
however you want to submit it, it's totally fine as long as anyone can view

**‚è∞ 00:19:22**
totally fine as long as anyone can view

**‚è∞ 00:19:22**
totally fine as long as anyone can view it. Um, and I'd also recommend making

**‚è∞ 00:19:24**
it. Um, and I'd also recommend making

**‚è∞ 00:19:24**
it. Um, and I'd also recommend making sure it's not just me who has access or

**‚è∞ 00:19:26**
sure it's not just me who has access or

**‚è∞ 00:19:26**
sure it's not just me who has access or just Marzia. I know when we share things

**‚è∞ 00:19:27**
just Marzia. I know when we share things

**‚è∞ 00:19:27**
just Marzia. I know when we share things on Google, we add, you know, specific

yeah and I think a genuine thoughtful

**‚è∞ 00:19:40**
yeah and I think a genuine thoughtful response matters more than perfect

**‚è∞ 00:19:42**
response matters more than perfect

**‚è∞ 00:19:42**
response matters more than perfect background. We're not looking for you to

really exciting. So yeah, a little bit of introduction about myself. My name is

**‚è∞ 00:24:05**
of introduction about myself. My name is

**‚è∞ 00:24:05**
of introduction about myself. My name is Omar Amari. Uh I'm based in London right

**‚è∞ 00:24:08**
Omar Amari. Uh I'm based in London right

**‚è∞ 00:24:08**
Omar Amari. Uh I'm based in London right now and I'm a research scholar started

**‚è∞ 00:24:11**
now and I'm a research scholar started

**‚è∞ 00:24:11**
now and I'm a research scholar started in January. So the uh most recent batch

**‚è∞ 00:24:15**
in January. So the uh most recent batch

**‚è∞ 00:24:15**
in January. So the uh most recent batch and yeah for the last month is I have

**‚è∞ 00:24:18**
and yeah for the last month is I have

**‚è∞ 00:24:18**
and yeah for the last month is I have the pleasure of working with co here on

**‚è∞ 00:24:21**
the pleasure of working with co here on

**‚è∞ 00:24:21**
the pleasure of working with co here on uh inference time scaling. So what I've

**‚è∞ 00:24:24**
uh inference time scaling. So what I've

**‚è∞ 00:24:24**
uh inference time scaling. So what I've been working on is how we can improve

**‚è∞ 00:24:27**
been working on is how we can improve

**‚è∞ 00:24:27**
been working on is how we can improve the performance of large language models

**‚è∞ 00:24:29**
the performance of large language models

**‚è∞ 00:24:29**
the performance of large language models at test time without needing to do like

**‚è∞ 00:24:31**
at test time without needing to do like

**‚è∞ 00:24:31**
at test time without needing to do like any training or uh gradient optimization

**‚è∞ 00:24:34**
any training or uh gradient optimization

**‚è∞ 00:24:34**
any training or uh gradient optimization and we apply this to uh multilingual and

**‚è∞ 00:24:38**
and we apply this to uh multilingual and

**‚è∞ 00:24:38**
and we apply this to uh multilingual and multitask uh situation and our work has

**‚è∞ 00:24:43**
multitask uh situation and our work has

**‚è∞ 00:24:43**
multitask uh situation and our work has been published and we have this metaphor

**‚è∞ 00:24:46**
been published and we have this metaphor

**‚è∞ 00:24:46**
been published and we have this metaphor of the LLM lemonade where we squeeze out

**‚è∞ 00:24:50**
of the LLM lemonade where we squeeze out

**‚è∞ 00:24:50**
of the LLM lemonade where we squeeze out the most uh the most performance of the

**‚è∞ 00:24:53**
the most uh the most performance of the

**‚è∞ 00:24:53**
the most uh the most performance of the models using the methods that we

**‚è∞ 00:24:54**
models using the methods that we

**‚è∞ 00:24:54**
models using the methods that we developed through the scholar program.

**‚è∞ 00:24:56**
developed through the scholar program.

**‚è∞ 00:24:56**
developed through the scholar program. Uh so it was a very exciting time and a

**‚è∞ 00:24:58**
Uh so it was a very exciting time and a

**‚è∞ 00:24:58**
Uh so it was a very exciting time and a very nice project and exciting to hear

2025 research scholar started in January as well. Um and I'm based in New York

**‚è∞ 00:25:19**
as well. Um and I'm based in New York


## üé§ Current Scholar

**‚è∞ 00:25:19**
as well. Um and I'm based in New York City. Um my project has been working on

**‚è∞ 00:25:23**
City. Um my project has been working on

**‚è∞ 00:25:23**
City. Um my project has been working on pre-training small geoclustered models

**‚è∞ 00:25:27**
pre-training small geoclustered models

**‚è∞ 00:25:27**
pre-training small geoclustered models um so around like a 3B scale um and

**‚è∞ 00:25:31**
um so around like a 3B scale um and

**‚è∞ 00:25:31**
um so around like a 3B scale um and looking at regions of the world for

**‚è∞ 00:25:33**
looking at regions of the world for

**‚è∞ 00:25:33**
looking at regions of the world for example like Europe um Middle East, Asia

**‚è∞ 00:25:36**
example like Europe um Middle East, Asia

**‚è∞ 00:25:36**
example like Europe um Middle East, Asia um to support the languages spoken in

**‚è∞ 00:25:38**
um to support the languages spoken in

**‚è∞ 00:25:38**
um to support the languages spoken in those regions. So it's been very

**‚è∞ 00:25:40**
those regions. So it's been very

**‚è∞ 00:25:40**
those regions. So it's been very exciting. Um we also published a paper

**‚è∞ 00:25:43**
exciting. Um we also published a paper

**‚è∞ 00:25:43**
exciting. Um we also published a paper on um training tokenizers to support um

**‚è∞ 00:25:47**
on um training tokenizers to support um

**‚è∞ 00:25:48**
on um training tokenizers to support um many many different languages in

**‚è∞ 00:25:49**
many many different languages in

**‚è∞ 00:25:49**
many many different languages in particular to enable um adaptation of

**‚è∞ 00:25:52**
particular to enable um adaptation of

**‚è∞ 00:25:52**
particular to enable um adaptation of that of that model in post- training

**‚è∞ 00:25:54**
that of that model in post- training

**‚è∞ 00:25:54**
that of that model in post- training more easily and how you can kind of um

**‚è∞ 00:25:58**
more easily and how you can kind of um

**‚è∞ 00:25:58**
more easily and how you can kind of um you can enable those capabilities even

**‚è∞ 00:26:00**
you can enable those capabilities even

**‚è∞ 00:26:00**
you can enable those capabilities even in the tokenization stage before you do

**‚è∞ 00:26:02**
in the tokenization stage before you do

**‚è∞ 00:26:02**
in the tokenization stage before you do any training. Um so yeah uh also very

**‚è∞ 00:26:06**
any training. Um so yeah uh also very

**‚è∞ 00:26:06**
any training. Um so yeah uh also very excited to share my experiences and

**‚è∞ 00:26:09**
excited to share my experiences and

**‚è∞ 00:26:09**
excited to share my experiences and welcome a new batch.

Amar and Diana will stick around for the

**‚è∞ 00:26:17**
Amar and Diana will stick around for the Q&amp;A that we'll jump into here in just a

**‚è∞ 00:26:19**
Q&amp;A that we'll jump into here in just a

**‚è∞ 00:26:19**
Q&amp;A that we'll jump into here in just a moment. So um if there are questions

**‚è∞ 00:26:22**
moment. So um if there are questions

**‚è∞ 00:26:22**
moment. So um if there are questions that are specific to the scholars and

**‚è∞ 00:26:25**
that are specific to the scholars and

**‚è∞ 00:26:25**
that are specific to the scholars and maybe what the program is like or

**‚è∞ 00:26:26**
maybe what the program is like or

**‚è∞ 00:26:26**
maybe what the program is like or something like that um feel free to ask

**‚è∞ 00:26:28**
something like that um feel free to ask

**‚è∞ 00:26:28**
something like that um feel free to ask those in the Q&amp;A and and we can we can

**‚è∞ 00:26:30**
those in the Q&amp;A and and we can we can

**‚è∞ 00:26:30**
those in the Q&amp;A and and we can we can put Amomar and Diana on the spot here.

**‚è∞ 00:26:33**
put Amomar and Diana on the spot here.

**‚è∞ 00:26:33**
put Amomar and Diana on the spot here. Um, so yeah, I think with that we'll

**‚è∞ 00:26:34**
Um, so yeah, I think with that we'll

**‚è∞ 00:26:34**
Um, so yeah, I think with that we'll jump into the Q&amp;A section of this call.

**‚è∞ 00:26:38**
jump into the Q&amp;A section of this call.

**‚è∞ 00:26:38**
jump into the Q&amp;A section of this call. Um, so it looks like people have been

**‚è∞ 00:26:41**
Um, so it looks like people have been

**‚è∞ 00:26:41**
Um, so it looks like people have been using the Q&amp;A, which is awesome. So we

**‚è∞ 00:26:43**
using the Q&amp;A, which is awesome. So we

**‚è∞ 00:26:43**
using the Q&amp;A, which is awesome. So we will take a look there. Marzy, if it's

**‚è∞ 00:26:45**
will take a look there. Marzy, if it's

**‚è∞ 00:26:45**
will take a look there. Marzy, if it's easier if you want to stop sharing

**‚è∞ 00:26:47**
easier if you want to stop sharing

**‚è∞ 00:26:47**
easier if you want to stop sharing screen, I think you can. For me, it's

**‚è∞ 00:26:49**
screen, I think you can. For me, it's

**‚è∞ 00:26:49**
screen, I think you can. For me, it's tricky to see Q&amp;A and screen. So you're

**‚è∞ 00:26:51**
tricky to see Q&amp;A and screen. So you're

**‚è∞ 00:26:51**
tricky to see Q&amp;A and screen. So you're welcome to stop sharing. Um, so yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:26:54**
welcome to stop sharing. Um, so yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:26:54**
welcome to stop sharing. Um, so yeah, let's take a look at the Q&amp;A here.

**‚è∞ 00:26:57**
let's take a look at the Q&amp;A here.

**‚è∞ 00:26:57**
let's take a look at the Q&amp;A here. There's a lot of questions that are

**‚è∞ 00:26:59**
There's a lot of questions that are

**‚è∞ 00:26:59**
There's a lot of questions that are talking about PhD students and can I

**‚è∞ 00:27:03**
talking about PhD students and can I

**‚è∞ 00:27:03**
talking about PhD students and can I apply if I'm at with as a PhD student.

**‚è∞ 00:27:05**
apply if I'm at with as a PhD student.

**‚è∞ 00:27:05**
apply if I'm at with as a PhD student. So, I'll quickly address that sort of as

**‚è∞ 00:27:07**
So, I'll quickly address that sort of as

**‚è∞ 00:27:08**
So, I'll quickly address that sort of as a whole. Unfortunately, not. This is a

**‚è∞ 00:27:10**
a whole. Unfortunately, not. This is a

**‚è∞ 00:27:10**
a whole. Unfortunately, not. This is a full-time um opportunity and we we don't

**‚è∞ 00:27:13**
full-time um opportunity and we we don't

**‚è∞ 00:27:13**
full-time um opportunity and we we don't allow people to be working as a PhD

**‚è∞ 00:27:15**
allow people to be working as a PhD

**‚è∞ 00:27:15**
allow people to be working as a PhD student at the same time. Um the reason

**‚è∞ 00:27:17**
student at the same time. Um the reason

**‚è∞ 00:27:17**
student at the same time. Um the reason being we really want you to focus on,

**‚è∞ 00:27:19**
being we really want you to focus on,

**‚è∞ 00:27:19**
being we really want you to focus on, you know, the opportunity to work at

**‚è∞ 00:27:21**
you know, the opportunity to work at

**‚è∞ 00:27:21**
you know, the opportunity to work at Coher Labs and it is a full-time um

**‚è∞ 00:27:25**
Coher Labs and it is a full-time um

**‚è∞ 00:27:25**
Coher Labs and it is a full-time um role. So it you would be stretched too

**‚è∞ 00:27:27**
role. So it you would be stretched too

**‚è∞ 00:27:27**
role. So it you would be stretched too thin, I think. So um yeah, we just

**‚è∞ 00:27:29**
thin, I think. So um yeah, we just

**‚è∞ 00:27:29**
thin, I think. So um yeah, we just really want you to focus in on the

**‚è∞ 00:27:31**
really want you to focus in on the

**‚è∞ 00:27:31**
really want you to focus in on the program. Um Marzy, is there any other is

**‚è∞ 00:27:33**
program. Um Marzy, is there any other is

**‚è∞ 00:27:33**
program. Um Marzy, is there any other is there some questions that you'd like to

**‚è∞ 00:27:36**
there some questions that you'd like to

**‚è∞ 00:27:36**
there some questions that you'd like to &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks. Uh there's actually a fun

**‚è∞ 00:27:38**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks. Uh there's actually a fun

**‚è∞ 00:27:38**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks. Uh there's actually a fun question for Diana or Amar, either of

**‚è∞ 00:27:41**
question for Diana or Amar, either of

**‚è∞ 00:27:41**
question for Diana or Amar, either of you. What does a typical day or week of

**‚è∞ 00:27:43**
you. What does a typical day or week of

**‚è∞ 00:27:43**
you. What does a typical day or week of a scholar look like?

**‚è∞ 00:27:47**
&gt;&gt; Who wants to go?

**‚è∞ 00:27:48**
&gt;&gt; Who wants to go?

**‚è∞ 00:27:48**
&gt;&gt; Who wants to go? &gt;&gt; Um I can go first. I guess it will

**‚è∞ 00:27:50**
&gt;&gt; Um I can go first. I guess it will

**‚è∞ 00:27:50**
&gt;&gt; Um I can go first. I guess it will probably be different between me and

**‚è∞ 00:27:52**
probably be different between me and

**‚è∞ 00:27:52**
probably be different between me and Amar, but um kind of generally like at

**‚è∞ 00:27:55**
Amar, but um kind of generally like at

**‚è∞ 00:27:55**
Amar, but um kind of generally like at the beginning of the program, most of

**‚è∞ 00:27:57**
the beginning of the program, most of

**‚è∞ 00:27:57**
the beginning of the program, most of your days are spent reading um doing

**‚è∞ 00:28:00**
your days are spent reading um doing

**‚è∞ 00:28:00**
your days are spent reading um doing literature review, building up your

**‚è∞ 00:28:02**
literature review, building up your

**‚è∞ 00:28:02**
literature review, building up your background knowledge in the area, um

**‚è∞ 00:28:04**
background knowledge in the area, um

**‚è∞ 00:28:04**
background knowledge in the area, um maybe suggesting some ideas, talking to

**‚è∞ 00:28:06**
maybe suggesting some ideas, talking to

**‚è∞ 00:28:06**
maybe suggesting some ideas, talking to your mentors about it. Um and then

**‚è∞ 00:28:09**
your mentors about it. Um and then

**‚è∞ 00:28:10**
your mentors about it. Um and then you're getting onboarded to um the

**‚è∞ 00:28:12**
you're getting onboarded to um the

**‚è∞ 00:28:12**
you're getting onboarded to um the existing infrastructure and libraries at

**‚è∞ 00:28:14**
existing infrastructure and libraries at

**‚è∞ 00:28:14**
existing infrastructure and libraries at Coher. Thankfully we get to um leverage

**‚è∞ 00:28:17**
Coher. Thankfully we get to um leverage

**‚è∞ 00:28:17**
Coher. Thankfully we get to um leverage those in running our experiments and

**‚è∞ 00:28:19**
those in running our experiments and

**‚è∞ 00:28:19**
those in running our experiments and stuff like that. So that can be a little

**‚è∞ 00:28:21**
stuff like that. So that can be a little

**‚è∞ 00:28:21**
stuff like that. So that can be a little difficult that can take some time. Um

**‚è∞ 00:28:23**
difficult that can take some time. Um

**‚è∞ 00:28:23**
difficult that can take some time. Um but once you get past that hurdle it

**‚è∞ 00:28:25**
but once you get past that hurdle it

**‚è∞ 00:28:25**
but once you get past that hurdle it enables um a lot of quick

**‚è∞ 00:28:27**
enables um a lot of quick

**‚è∞ 00:28:27**
enables um a lot of quick experimentation. Um and then for me um

**‚è∞ 00:28:30**
experimentation. Um and then for me um

**‚è∞ 00:28:30**
experimentation. Um and then for me um the days past that point are a lot of

**‚è∞ 00:28:32**
the days past that point are a lot of

**‚è∞ 00:28:32**
the days past that point are a lot of like um coming up with experiments,

**‚è∞ 00:28:35**
like um coming up with experiments,

**‚è∞ 00:28:35**
like um coming up with experiments, experiment monitoring, um interpreting

**‚è∞ 00:28:38**
experiment monitoring, um interpreting

**‚è∞ 00:28:38**
experiment monitoring, um interpreting results um and determining like how to

**‚è∞ 00:28:41**
results um and determining like how to

**‚è∞ 00:28:41**
results um and determining like how to move forward from there. um digging

**‚è∞ 00:28:44**
move forward from there. um digging

**‚è∞ 00:28:44**
move forward from there. um digging around for bugs, um writing one-off

**‚è∞ 00:28:47**
around for bugs, um writing one-off

**‚è∞ 00:28:47**
around for bugs, um writing one-off scripts here and there. So, uh the days

**‚è∞ 00:28:50**
scripts here and there. So, uh the days

**‚è∞ 00:28:50**
scripts here and there. So, uh the days look very different in in different

**‚è∞ 00:28:51**
look very different in in different

**‚è∞ 00:28:51**
look very different in in different phases of the program. Um beyond that,

**‚è∞ 00:28:54**
phases of the program. Um beyond that,

**‚è∞ 00:28:54**
phases of the program. Um beyond that, there's also like the paperwriting stage

**‚è∞ 00:28:56**
there's also like the paperwriting stage

**‚è∞ 00:28:56**
there's also like the paperwriting stage and that's mostly like you're staring at

**‚è∞ 00:28:58**
and that's mostly like you're staring at

**‚è∞ 00:28:58**
and that's mostly like you're staring at your Overleaf document. Um you're

**‚è∞ 00:29:01**
your Overleaf document. Um you're

**‚è∞ 00:29:01**
your Overleaf document. Um you're tinkering around with plots in Mattplot

**‚è∞ 00:29:04**
tinkering around with plots in Mattplot

**‚è∞ 00:29:04**
tinkering around with plots in Mattplot Live. Um making sure that things look

**‚è∞ 00:29:06**
Live. Um making sure that things look

**‚è∞ 00:29:06**
Live. Um making sure that things look good. Um, so the days are extremely

**‚è∞ 00:29:09**
good. Um, so the days are extremely

**‚è∞ 00:29:09**
good. Um, so the days are extremely varied, but I think that's actually

**‚è∞ 00:29:11**
varied, but I think that's actually

**‚è∞ 00:29:11**
varied, but I think that's actually great because it doesn't it's not

**‚è∞ 00:29:12**
great because it doesn't it's not

**‚è∞ 00:29:12**
great because it doesn't it's not monotonous. Um, and you find the time

**‚è∞ 00:29:15**
monotonous. Um, and you find the time

**‚è∞ 00:29:15**
monotonous. Um, and you find the time throughout to um, of course like keep

**‚è∞ 00:29:17**
throughout to um, of course like keep

**‚è∞ 00:29:17**
throughout to um, of course like keep reading and and keep asking questions.

**‚è∞ 00:29:24**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead.

**‚è∞ 00:29:26**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead.

**‚è∞ 00:29:26**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh yeah, I just wanted to add like

**‚è∞ 00:29:29**
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh yeah, I just wanted to add like

**‚è∞ 00:29:29**
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh yeah, I just wanted to add like to what the Anna said like it's a great

**‚è∞ 00:29:31**
to what the Anna said like it's a great

**‚è∞ 00:29:31**
to what the Anna said like it's a great answer and yeah, I think the main point

**‚è∞ 00:29:34**
answer and yeah, I think the main point

**‚è∞ 00:29:34**
answer and yeah, I think the main point is that every day or every week is

**‚è∞ 00:29:36**
is that every day or every week is

**‚è∞ 00:29:36**
is that every day or every week is different when you're at the scholar

**‚è∞ 00:29:37**
different when you're at the scholar

**‚è∞ 00:29:37**
different when you're at the scholar program and yeah uh one of the things

**‚è∞ 00:29:42**
program and yeah uh one of the things

**‚è∞ 00:29:42**
program and yeah uh one of the things that you also do that as you are running

**‚è∞ 00:29:44**
that you also do that as you are running

**‚è∞ 00:29:44**
that you also do that as you are running experiments and as you are coming with

**‚è∞ 00:29:46**
experiments and as you are coming with

**‚è∞ 00:29:46**
experiments and as you are coming with results uh you get to talk with your

**‚è∞ 00:29:49**
results uh you get to talk with your

**‚è∞ 00:29:49**
results uh you get to talk with your mentors mostly on a weekly basis and you

**‚è∞ 00:29:52**
mentors mostly on a weekly basis and you

**‚è∞ 00:29:52**
mentors mostly on a weekly basis and you have like the

**‚è∞ 00:29:55**
have like the

**‚è∞ 00:29:55**
have like the uh the freedom to see what the results

**‚è∞ 00:29:58**
uh the freedom to see what the results

**‚è∞ 00:29:58**
uh the freedom to see what the results are are how you interpret them and you

**‚è∞ 00:30:00**
are are how you interpret them and you

**‚è∞ 00:30:00**
are are how you interpret them and you can discuss with your mentors how you

**‚è∞ 00:30:02**
can discuss with your mentors how you

**‚è∞ 00:30:02**
can discuss with your mentors how you can which direction you want to go into

**‚è∞ 00:30:04**
can which direction you want to go into

**‚è∞ 00:30:04**
can which direction you want to go into your research. So that's also like an

**‚è∞ 00:30:06**
your research. So that's also like an

**‚è∞ 00:30:06**
your research. So that's also like an interesting part that I want to

**‚è∞ 00:30:07**
interesting part that I want to

**‚è∞ 00:30:07**
interesting part that I want to highlight of my day like these

**‚è∞ 00:30:08**
highlight of my day like these

**‚è∞ 00:30:08**
highlight of my day like these discussions like every week are some

**‚è∞ 00:30:10**
discussions like every week are some

**‚è∞ 00:30:10**
discussions like every week are some nice parts of the program.

**‚è∞ 00:30:13**
nice parts of the program.

**‚è∞ 00:30:13**
nice parts of the program. Yeah, that's uh that's very nice and

**‚è∞ 00:30:15**
Yeah, that's uh that's very nice and

**‚è∞ 00:30:15**
Yeah, that's uh that's very nice and maybe I can connect it to another

**‚è∞ 00:30:16**
maybe I can connect it to another

**‚è∞ 00:30:16**
maybe I can connect it to another question which is about what is the

**‚è∞ 00:30:18**
question which is about what is the

**‚è∞ 00:30:18**
question which is about what is the structure of the research scholar

**‚è∞ 00:30:21**
structure of the research scholar

**‚è∞ 00:30:21**
structure of the research scholar program for instance weekly agenda

**‚è∞ 00:30:23**
program for instance weekly agenda

**‚è∞ 00:30:23**
program for instance weekly agenda milestones and um I would say that it's

**‚è∞ 00:30:28**
milestones and um I would say that it's

**‚è∞ 00:30:28**
milestones and um I would say that it's again like similar to what uh Diana

**‚è∞ 00:30:31**
again like similar to what uh Diana

**‚è∞ 00:30:31**
again like similar to what uh Diana mentioned it changes throughout the the

**‚è∞ 00:30:33**
mentioned it changes throughout the the

**‚è∞ 00:30:33**
mentioned it changes throughout the the project depending on the phase of the

**‚è∞ 00:30:35**
project depending on the phase of the

**‚è∞ 00:30:35**
project depending on the phase of the project but there are some uh constants

**‚è∞ 00:30:38**
project but there are some uh constants

**‚è∞ 00:30:38**
project but there are some uh constants there so for instance we uh for each

**‚è∞ 00:30:41**
there so for instance we uh for each

**‚è∞ 00:30:41**
there so for instance we uh for each project there is a weekly project

**‚è∞ 00:30:43**
project there is a weekly project

**‚è∞ 00:30:43**
project there is a weekly project meeting where uh every mentor of the

**‚è∞ 00:30:45**
meeting where uh every mentor of the

**‚è∞ 00:30:45**
meeting where uh every mentor of the project and the scholar they meet they

**‚è∞ 00:30:47**
project and the scholar they meet they

**‚è∞ 00:30:47**
project and the scholar they meet they talk about the progress and the next

**‚è∞ 00:30:50**
talk about the progress and the next

**‚è∞ 00:30:50**
talk about the progress and the next steps. Usually uh the the scholar and

**‚è∞ 00:30:53**
steps. Usually uh the the scholar and

**‚è∞ 00:30:53**
steps. Usually uh the the scholar and the main mentor uh they have weekly

**‚è∞ 00:30:56**
the main mentor uh they have weekly

**‚è∞ 00:30:56**
the main mentor uh they have weekly one-on- ones and that's also uh that's

**‚è∞ 00:30:58**
one-on- ones and that's also uh that's

**‚è∞ 00:30:58**
one-on- ones and that's also uh that's one of the things that might change

**‚è∞ 00:31:00**
one of the things that might change

**‚è∞ 00:31:00**
one of the things that might change throughout the phase of the project. So

**‚è∞ 00:31:02**
throughout the phase of the project. So

**‚è∞ 00:31:02**
throughout the phase of the project. So maybe it would start once a week as it

**‚è∞ 00:31:04**
maybe it would start once a week as it

**‚è∞ 00:31:04**
maybe it would start once a week as it gets closer to maybe looking at the

**‚è∞ 00:31:06**
gets closer to maybe looking at the

**‚è∞ 00:31:06**
gets closer to maybe looking at the code, analyzing the results um or

**‚è∞ 00:31:10**
code, analyzing the results um or

**‚è∞ 00:31:10**
code, analyzing the results um or actually debugging or the the paper even

**‚è∞ 00:31:13**
actually debugging or the the paper even

**‚è∞ 00:31:13**
actually debugging or the the paper even paper writing stage you might meet every

**‚è∞ 00:31:15**
paper writing stage you might meet every

**‚è∞ 00:31:15**
paper writing stage you might meet every day. Um and uh the the main milestones

**‚è∞ 00:31:20**
day. Um and uh the the main milestones

**‚è∞ 00:31:20**
day. Um and uh the the main milestones that we have is to publish the work in

**‚è∞ 00:31:23**
that we have is to publish the work in

**‚è∞ 00:31:23**
that we have is to publish the work in the end. So depending on when the paper

**‚è∞ 00:31:25**
the end. So depending on when the paper

**‚è∞ 00:31:25**
the end. So depending on when the paper is ready and the the conference

**‚è∞ 00:31:27**
is ready and the the conference

**‚è∞ 00:31:27**
is ready and the the conference deadlines uh that is something that we

**‚è∞ 00:31:29**
deadlines uh that is something that we

**‚è∞ 00:31:29**
deadlines uh that is something that we usually plan uh publications and

**‚è∞ 00:31:32**
usually plan uh publications and

**‚è∞ 00:31:32**
usually plan uh publications and releases of models data resources

**‚è∞ 00:31:36**
releases of models data resources

**‚è∞ 00:31:36**
releases of models data resources and then we also have an internal like I

**‚è∞ 00:31:39**
and then we also have an internal like I

**‚è∞ 00:31:39**
and then we also have an internal like I mentioned if we uh usually in the middle

**‚è∞ 00:31:42**
mentioned if we uh usually in the middle

**‚è∞ 00:31:42**
mentioned if we uh usually in the middle of the program we all meet in person and

**‚è∞ 00:31:45**
of the program we all meet in person and

**‚è∞ 00:31:45**
of the program we all meet in person and that is kind of like an internal

**‚è∞ 00:31:47**
that is kind of like an internal

**‚è∞ 00:31:47**
that is kind of like an internal deadline as well to report the uh the

**‚è∞ 00:31:49**
deadline as well to report the uh the

**‚è∞ 00:31:49**
deadline as well to report the uh the work that is in progress. So that's

**‚è∞ 00:31:51**
work that is in progress. So that's

**‚è∞ 00:31:51**
work that is in progress. So that's another milestone there.

**‚è∞ 00:31:56**
Uh any other questions you find? And I

**‚è∞ 00:31:58**
Uh any other questions you find? And I

**‚è∞ 00:31:58**
Uh any other questions you find? And I also see some raising hands. Maybe we

**‚è∞ 00:32:00**
also see some raising hands. Maybe we

**‚è∞ 00:32:00**
also see some raising hands. Maybe we can also

**‚è∞ 00:32:02**
can also

**‚è∞ 00:32:02**
can also uh yeah, if anyone wants to unmute and

**‚è∞ 00:32:06**
uh yeah, if anyone wants to unmute and

**‚è∞ 00:32:06**
uh yeah, if anyone wants to unmute and ask questions, you can do that.

**‚è∞ 00:32:11**
&gt;&gt; Okay. until we get to that. I see this

**‚è∞ 00:32:14**
&gt;&gt; Okay. until we get to that. I see this

**‚è∞ 00:32:14**
&gt;&gt; Okay. until we get to that. I see this interesting question from Yasm mean here

**‚è∞ 00:32:17**
interesting question from Yasm mean here

**‚è∞ 00:32:17**
interesting question from Yasm mean here uh asking about like uh from a

**‚è∞ 00:32:21**
uh asking about like uh from a

**‚è∞ 00:32:21**
uh asking about like uh from a background in telecommunications

**‚è∞ 00:32:23**
background in telecommunications

**‚è∞ 00:32:23**
background in telecommunications would it be reasonable to apply to the

**‚è∞ 00:32:25**
would it be reasonable to apply to the

**‚è∞ 00:32:25**
would it be reasonable to apply to the scholar program and I would say 100% it

**‚è∞ 00:32:27**
scholar program and I would say 100% it

**‚è∞ 00:32:27**
scholar program and I would say 100% it is uh the scholar program is mostly

**‚è∞ 00:32:30**
is uh the scholar program is mostly

**‚è∞ 00:32:30**
is uh the scholar program is mostly designed to as an entry point to

**‚è∞ 00:32:33**
designed to as an entry point to

**‚è∞ 00:32:33**
designed to as an entry point to traditional and uh early career stages

**‚è∞ 00:32:36**
traditional and uh early career stages

**‚è∞ 00:32:36**
traditional and uh early career stages into AI research. So if you feel like

Yeah. Thanks, Samar. I see another one here

**‚è∞ 00:33:09**
Thanks, Samar. I see another one here

**‚è∞ 00:33:09**
Thanks, Samar. I see another one here for Diana and Amar specifically. It

**‚è∞ 00:33:11**
for Diana and Amar specifically. It

**‚è∞ 00:33:11**
for Diana and Amar specifically. It talks about speaking on the involvement

**‚è∞ 00:33:12**
talks about speaking on the involvement

**‚è∞ 00:33:12**
talks about speaking on the involvement of mentorship um and the available of

**‚è∞ 00:33:15**
of mentorship um and the available of

**‚è∞ 00:33:15**
of mentorship um and the available of compute to run self-directed

**‚è∞ 00:33:17**
compute to run self-directed

**‚è∞ 00:33:17**
compute to run self-directed experiments. Do you want to talk about a

**‚è∞ 00:33:19**
experiments. Do you want to talk about a

**‚è∞ 00:33:19**
experiments. Do you want to talk about a little bit about that? I think

**‚è∞ 00:33:20**
little bit about that? I think

**‚è∞ 00:33:20**
little bit about that? I think specifically the mentorship is something

**‚è∞ 00:33:22**
specifically the mentorship is something

**‚è∞ 00:33:22**
specifically the mentorship is something that that is that would be nice to hear

**‚è∞ 00:33:24**
that that is that would be nice to hear

**‚è∞ 00:33:24**
that that is that would be nice to hear about.

**‚è∞ 00:33:26**
about.

**‚è∞ 00:33:26**
about. &gt;&gt; Um I can go first. I guess mentorship is

**‚è∞ 00:33:29**
&gt;&gt; Um I can go first. I guess mentorship is

**‚è∞ 00:33:29**
&gt;&gt; Um I can go first. I guess mentorship is truly phenomenal. Um that was a huge

**‚è∞ 00:33:31**
truly phenomenal. Um that was a huge

**‚è∞ 00:33:32**
truly phenomenal. Um that was a huge draw for me to this program because um

**‚è∞ 00:33:35**
draw for me to this program because um

**‚è∞ 00:33:35**
draw for me to this program because um you know it can be hard to come by in

**‚è∞ 00:33:36**
you know it can be hard to come by in

**‚è∞ 00:33:36**
you know it can be hard to come by in other places and this is specifically

**‚è∞ 00:33:38**
other places and this is specifically

**‚è∞ 00:33:38**
other places and this is specifically like eight months of uh these um

**‚è∞ 00:33:41**
like eight months of uh these um

**‚è∞ 00:33:42**
like eight months of uh these um incredible accomplished researchers who

**‚è∞ 00:33:44**
incredible accomplished researchers who

**‚è∞ 00:33:44**
incredible accomplished researchers who are like very available um to speak with

**‚è∞ 00:33:46**
are like very available um to speak with

**‚è∞ 00:33:46**
are like very available um to speak with you and uh you know you get to explore

**‚è∞ 00:33:50**
you and uh you know you get to explore

**‚è∞ 00:33:50**
you and uh you know you get to explore these really interesting questions

**‚è∞ 00:33:51**
these really interesting questions

**‚è∞ 00:33:52**
these really interesting questions together with them and like um ask them

**‚è∞ 00:33:55**
together with them and like um ask them

**‚è∞ 00:33:55**
together with them and like um ask them questions and see also like what is

**‚è∞ 00:33:56**
questions and see also like what is

**‚è∞ 00:33:56**
questions and see also like what is their research um instinct um what kinds

**‚è∞ 00:34:00**
their research um instinct um what kinds

**‚è∞ 00:34:00**
their research um instinct um what kinds of questions do do they ask and how

**‚è∞ 00:34:02**
of questions do do they ask and how

**‚è∞ 00:34:02**
of questions do do they ask and how would they investigate them? That has

**‚è∞ 00:34:04**
would they investigate them? That has

**‚è∞ 00:34:04**
would they investigate them? That has been like very interesting for me to

**‚è∞ 00:34:06**
been like very interesting for me to

**‚è∞ 00:34:06**
been like very interesting for me to pick up on and to kind of develop my

**‚è∞ 00:34:08**
pick up on and to kind of develop my

**‚è∞ 00:34:08**
pick up on and to kind of develop my intuition as a researcher. Um and then

**‚è∞ 00:34:11**
intuition as a researcher. Um and then

**‚è∞ 00:34:11**
intuition as a researcher. Um and then also like career stuff um or general

**‚è∞ 00:34:14**
also like career stuff um or general

**‚è∞ 00:34:14**
also like career stuff um or general personal stuff like people are very

**‚è∞ 00:34:15**
personal stuff like people are very

**‚è∞ 00:34:15**
personal stuff like people are very available to just talk with you about

career. So that's been really great. Um

**‚è∞ 00:34:37**
career. So that's been really great. Um quickly on the compute question, lots of

**‚è∞ 00:34:40**
quickly on the compute question, lots of

**‚è∞ 00:34:40**
quickly on the compute question, lots of compute available thankfully. I mean

**‚è∞ 00:34:41**
compute available thankfully. I mean

**‚è∞ 00:34:42**
compute available thankfully. I mean there's there's definitely restrictions

**‚è∞ 00:34:44**
there's there's definitely restrictions

**‚è∞ 00:34:44**
there's there's definitely restrictions and you want to use it wisely but um

**‚è∞ 00:34:47**
and you want to use it wisely but um

**‚è∞ 00:34:47**
and you want to use it wisely but um another huge appeal of the program is

**‚è∞ 00:34:49**
another huge appeal of the program is

**‚è∞ 00:34:49**
another huge appeal of the program is that a lot of us um come from places

**‚è∞ 00:34:51**
that a lot of us um come from places

**‚è∞ 00:34:52**
that a lot of us um come from places where uh that's really hard to come by

**‚è∞ 00:34:54**
where uh that's really hard to come by

**‚è∞ 00:34:54**
where uh that's really hard to come by um even in universities um compute is

**‚è∞ 00:34:57**
um even in universities um compute is

**‚è∞ 00:34:57**
um even in universities um compute is restricted and you definitely have

**‚è∞ 00:35:00**
restricted and you definitely have

**‚è∞ 00:35:00**
restricted and you definitely have access to like more of it here that that

**‚è∞ 00:35:02**
access to like more of it here that that

**‚è∞ 00:35:02**
access to like more of it here that that opens up the door to more

**‚è∞ 00:35:03**
opens up the door to more

**‚è∞ 00:35:04**
opens up the door to more experimentation.

**‚è∞ 00:35:07**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a question here I want to

**‚è∞ 00:35:09**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a question here I want to

**‚è∞ 00:35:09**
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a question here I want to quickly say. So uh Muhammad asked do you

**‚è∞ 00:35:12**
quickly say. So uh Muhammad asked do you

**‚è∞ 00:35:12**
quickly say. So uh Muhammad asked do you choose what area of research you will

**‚è∞ 00:35:14**
choose what area of research you will

**‚è∞ 00:35:14**
choose what area of research you will work on if selected and uh we uh the the

**‚è∞ 00:35:18**
work on if selected and uh we uh the the

**‚è∞ 00:35:18**
work on if selected and uh we uh the the the main mentors and uh uh the the group

**‚è∞ 00:35:21**
the main mentors and uh uh the the group

**‚è∞ 00:35:21**
the main mentors and uh uh the the group of people who will work on the project

**‚è∞ 00:35:23**
of people who will work on the project

**‚è∞ 00:35:24**
of people who will work on the project they will come up with the ideas. So

**‚è∞ 00:35:25**
they will come up with the ideas. So

**‚è∞ 00:35:25**
they will come up with the ideas. So there are uh that is how we we set the

**‚è∞ 00:35:29**
there are uh that is how we we set the

**‚è∞ 00:35:29**
there are uh that is how we we set the research agenda of our lab. So uh in the

**‚è∞ 00:35:33**
research agenda of our lab. So uh in the

**‚è∞ 00:35:33**
research agenda of our lab. So uh in the final round of uh the interview process,

**‚è∞ 00:35:36**
final round of uh the interview process,

**‚è∞ 00:35:36**
final round of uh the interview process, there's also this aspect of matching

**‚è∞ 00:35:39**
there's also this aspect of matching

**‚è∞ 00:35:39**
there's also this aspect of matching candidates, potential candidates to

**‚è∞ 00:35:41**
candidates, potential candidates to

**‚è∞ 00:35:41**
candidates, potential candidates to projects that we have defined for next

**‚è∞ 00:35:43**
projects that we have defined for next

**‚è∞ 00:35:43**
projects that we have defined for next year. Uh you will still have uh of

**‚è∞ 00:35:47**
year. Uh you will still have uh of

**‚è∞ 00:35:47**
year. Uh you will still have uh of course uh autonomy to come up with uh

**‚è∞ 00:35:50**
course uh autonomy to come up with uh

**‚è∞ 00:35:50**
course uh autonomy to come up with uh maybe new solutions or or different ways

**‚è∞ 00:35:53**
maybe new solutions or or different ways

**‚è∞ 00:35:53**
maybe new solutions or or different ways to explore that problem. But the main uh

**‚è∞ 00:35:55**
to explore that problem. But the main uh

**‚è∞ 00:35:55**
to explore that problem. But the main uh the the main research question that you

**‚è∞ 00:35:57**
the the main research question that you

**‚è∞ 00:35:57**
the the main research question that you want to uh that you will be working on

**‚è∞ 00:36:00**
want to uh that you will be working on

**‚è∞ 00:36:00**
want to uh that you will be working on uh will be defined before you join the

**‚è∞ 00:36:02**
uh will be defined before you join the

**‚è∞ 00:36:02**
uh will be defined before you join the program.

**‚è∞ 00:36:04**
program.

**‚è∞ 00:36:04**
program. &gt;&gt; I can also add to this um whatever you

**‚è∞ 00:36:07**
&gt;&gt; I can also add to this um whatever you

**‚è∞ 00:36:07**
&gt;&gt; I can also add to this um whatever you end up working on it's very much

**‚è∞ 00:36:09**
end up working on it's very much

**‚è∞ 00:36:09**
end up working on it's very much determined by your interests. Um and so

**‚è∞ 00:36:12**
determined by your interests. Um and so

**‚è∞ 00:36:12**
determined by your interests. Um and so the the lab like they put in a lot of

**‚è∞ 00:36:15**
the the lab like they put in a lot of

**‚è∞ 00:36:15**
the the lab like they put in a lot of effort to pair um scholars with projects

**‚è∞ 00:36:18**
effort to pair um scholars with projects

**‚è∞ 00:36:18**
effort to pair um scholars with projects that they would be really interested in

**‚è∞ 00:36:19**
that they would be really interested in

**‚è∞ 00:36:19**
that they would be really interested in running um sorry in working on. Um so uh

**‚è∞ 00:36:24**
running um sorry in working on. Um so uh

**‚è∞ 00:36:24**
running um sorry in working on. Um so uh while the projects are like

**‚è∞ 00:36:25**
while the projects are like

**‚è∞ 00:36:25**
while the projects are like predetermined um that pairing um is very

**‚è∞ 00:36:28**
predetermined um that pairing um is very

**‚è∞ 00:36:28**
predetermined um that pairing um is very much open and you want to show uh the

**‚è∞ 00:36:31**
much open and you want to show uh the

**‚è∞ 00:36:31**
much open and you want to show uh the areas that you're the most interested

**‚è∞ 00:36:32**
areas that you're the most interested

**‚è∞ 00:36:32**
areas that you're the most interested in.

**‚è∞ 00:36:37**
I like another question maybe I can uh

**‚è∞ 00:36:40**
I like another question maybe I can uh

**‚è∞ 00:36:40**
I like another question maybe I can uh and Britannia feel free to if you also

**‚è∞ 00:36:42**
and Britannia feel free to if you also

**‚è∞ 00:36:42**
and Britannia feel free to if you also find some questions uh let us know but

**‚è∞ 00:36:44**
find some questions uh let us know but

**‚è∞ 00:36:44**
find some questions uh let us know but uh there is a question from Sami uh and

**‚è∞ 00:36:47**
uh there is a question from Sami uh and

**‚è∞ 00:36:47**
uh there is a question from Sami uh and they ask what are the specific skills

**‚è∞ 00:36:49**
they ask what are the specific skills

**‚è∞ 00:36:49**
they ask what are the specific skills that you value the most in a scholar and

**‚è∞ 00:36:52**
that you value the most in a scholar and

**‚è∞ 00:36:52**
that you value the most in a scholar and I think it's a good open-ended question

**‚è∞ 00:36:55**
I think it's a good open-ended question

**‚è∞ 00:36:55**
I think it's a good open-ended question that uh maybe I can share uh from my

**‚è∞ 00:36:59**
that uh maybe I can share uh from my

**‚è∞ 00:36:59**
that uh maybe I can share uh from my perspective and my experience and also

**‚è∞ 00:37:01**
perspective and my experience and also

**‚è∞ 00:37:01**
perspective and my experience and also then Diana and Emar maybe you can share

**‚è∞ 00:37:04**
then Diana and Emar maybe you can share

**‚è∞ 00:37:04**
then Diana and Emar maybe you can share what in your mind like makes a

**‚è∞ 00:37:06**
what in your mind like makes a

**‚è∞ 00:37:06**
what in your mind like makes a successful scholar. Um so

**‚è∞ 00:37:10**
successful scholar. Um so

**‚è∞ 00:37:10**
successful scholar. Um so the design of this program is in a way

**‚è∞ 00:37:13**
the design of this program is in a way

**‚è∞ 00:37:13**
the design of this program is in a way that we look for

**‚è∞ 00:37:15**
that we look for

**‚è∞ 00:37:15**
that we look for uh people that are more junior. So like

**‚è∞ 00:37:18**
uh people that are more junior. So like

**‚è∞ 00:37:18**
uh people that are more junior. So like uh if you uh especially emerging talent

**‚è∞ 00:37:22**
uh if you uh especially emerging talent

**‚è∞ 00:37:22**
uh if you uh especially emerging talent who wants to get involved in research

**‚è∞ 00:37:24**
who wants to get involved in research

**‚è∞ 00:37:24**
who wants to get involved in research that means that it's going to be it's

**‚è∞ 00:37:26**
that means that it's going to be it's

**‚è∞ 00:37:26**
that means that it's going to be it's not going to be easy like if you haven't

**‚è∞ 00:37:29**
not going to be easy like if you haven't

**‚è∞ 00:37:29**
not going to be easy like if you haven't really worked on a research project in

**‚è∞ 00:37:31**
really worked on a research project in

**‚è∞ 00:37:31**
really worked on a research project in that scale. Uh there's definitely going

**‚è∞ 00:37:33**
that scale. Uh there's definitely going

**‚è∞ 00:37:33**
that scale. Uh there's definitely going to be challenges to to learn and to

**‚è∞ 00:37:37**
to be challenges to to learn and to

**‚è∞ 00:37:37**
to be challenges to to learn and to adapt. But what skill is really

**‚è∞ 00:37:40**
adapt. But what skill is really

**‚è∞ 00:37:40**
adapt. But what skill is really important to have to be successful is uh

**‚è∞ 00:37:44**
important to have to be successful is uh

**‚è∞ 00:37:44**
important to have to be successful is uh resilience and really really persistency

**‚è∞ 00:37:48**
resilience and really really persistency

**‚è∞ 00:37:48**
resilience and really really persistency in in your work and trusting the

**‚è∞ 00:37:51**
in in your work and trusting the

**‚è∞ 00:37:51**
in in your work and trusting the process. So research is going to be uh a

**‚è∞ 00:37:55**
process. So research is going to be uh a

**‚è∞ 00:37:55**
process. So research is going to be uh a lot of downs before there is an up like

**‚è∞ 00:37:57**
lot of downs before there is an up like

**‚è∞ 00:37:57**
lot of downs before there is an up like you uh almost never the first experiment

**‚è∞ 00:38:00**
you uh almost never the first experiment

**‚è∞ 00:38:00**
you uh almost never the first experiment will work and the first solution will

**‚è∞ 00:38:02**
will work and the first solution will

**‚è∞ 00:38:02**
will work and the first solution will work. So really uh having this attitude

**‚è∞ 00:38:05**
work. So really uh having this attitude

**‚è∞ 00:38:05**
work. So really uh having this attitude of not getting disappointed uh

**‚è∞ 00:38:08**
of not getting disappointed uh

**‚è∞ 00:38:08**
of not getting disappointed uh continuing to push uh to find that

**‚è∞ 00:38:10**
continuing to push uh to find that

**‚è∞ 00:38:10**
continuing to push uh to find that little gem in all of the work that you

**‚è∞ 00:38:12**
little gem in all of the work that you

**‚è∞ 00:38:12**
little gem in all of the work that you are doing. I think that makes a big

**‚è∞ 00:38:16**
are doing. I think that makes a big

**‚è∞ 00:38:16**
are doing. I think that makes a big difference uh between a successful

**‚è∞ 00:38:18**
difference uh between a successful

**‚è∞ 00:38:18**
difference uh between a successful scholar u and uh someone who might not

**‚è∞ 00:38:22**
scholar u and uh someone who might not

**‚è∞ 00:38:22**
scholar u and uh someone who might not succeed. Of course this means also a

**‚è∞ 00:38:26**
succeed. Of course this means also a

**‚è∞ 00:38:26**
succeed. Of course this means also a really excellent level of machine

**‚è∞ 00:38:28**
really excellent level of machine

**‚è∞ 00:38:28**
really excellent level of machine learning engineering uh background and

**‚è∞ 00:38:31**
learning engineering uh background and

**‚è∞ 00:38:31**
learning engineering uh background and skill set. So you you do want to be able

**‚è∞ 00:38:33**
skill set. So you you do want to be able

**‚è∞ 00:38:33**
skill set. So you you do want to be able to iterate quite fast on different

**‚è∞ 00:38:36**
to iterate quite fast on different

**‚è∞ 00:38:36**
to iterate quite fast on different experiments and um

**‚è∞ 00:38:39**
experiments and um

**‚è∞ 00:38:39**
experiments and um uh be uh skillful in figuring out

**‚è∞ 00:38:44**
uh be uh skillful in figuring out

**‚è∞ 00:38:44**
uh be uh skillful in figuring out problems and issues and things like

**‚è∞ 00:38:46**
problems and issues and things like

**‚è∞ 00:38:46**
problems and issues and things like that. So there's also like that aspect

**‚è∞ 00:38:49**
that. So there's also like that aspect

**‚è∞ 00:38:49**
that. So there's also like that aspect that I think by like each of them by

**‚è∞ 00:38:51**
that I think by like each of them by

**‚è∞ 00:38:51**
that I think by like each of them by themselves are not really uh uh enough

**‚è∞ 00:38:54**
themselves are not really uh uh enough

**‚è∞ 00:38:54**
themselves are not really uh uh enough in my mind but putting them together

**‚è∞ 00:38:57**
in my mind but putting them together

**‚è∞ 00:38:57**
in my mind but putting them together someone with a strong engineering

**‚è∞ 00:38:58**
someone with a strong engineering

**‚è∞ 00:38:58**
someone with a strong engineering background that is really prepared to

**‚è∞ 00:39:01**
background that is really prepared to

**‚è∞ 00:39:01**
background that is really prepared to dig deep and go through the process of

**‚è∞ 00:39:03**
dig deep and go through the process of

**‚è∞ 00:39:03**
dig deep and go through the process of failure to get to the success. Uh that

**‚è∞ 00:39:07**
failure to get to the success. Uh that

**‚è∞ 00:39:07**
failure to get to the success. Uh that in my mind is a really nice combination.

**‚è∞ 00:39:11**
in my mind is a really nice combination.

**‚è∞ 00:39:11**
in my mind is a really nice combination. Uh what do you think guys?

**‚è∞ 00:39:17**
[Music]

**‚è∞ 00:39:19**
[Music]

**‚è∞ 00:39:19**
[Music] Yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:39:21**
Yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:39:21**
Yeah, I think this is a very good answer in

**‚è∞ 00:39:24**
I think this is a very good answer in

**‚è∞ 00:39:24**
I think this is a very good answer in general. I was looking at some other

**‚è∞ 00:39:27**
general. I was looking at some other

**‚è∞ 00:39:27**
general. I was looking at some other questions that I also think is uh kind

**‚è∞ 00:39:30**
questions that I also think is uh kind

**‚è∞ 00:39:30**
questions that I also think is uh kind of uh related to this aspect. Uh asking

**‚è∞ 00:39:33**
of uh related to this aspect. Uh asking

**‚è∞ 00:39:33**
of uh related to this aspect. Uh asking about the uh me and Diana about our

**‚è∞ 00:39:37**
about the uh me and Diana about our

**‚è∞ 00:39:37**
about the uh me and Diana about our background and what we did before this.

**‚è∞ 00:39:40**
background and what we did before this.

**‚è∞ 00:39:40**
background and what we did before this. uh and I want to take this question as a

**‚è∞ 00:39:42**
uh and I want to take this question as a

**‚è∞ 00:39:42**
uh and I want to take this question as a chance to maybe talk about my background

**‚è∞ 00:39:44**
chance to maybe talk about my background

**‚è∞ 00:39:44**
chance to maybe talk about my background and also like how you can use that in

**‚è∞ 00:39:46**
and also like how you can use that in

**‚è∞ 00:39:46**
and also like how you can use that in the application process. So before this

**‚è∞ 00:39:49**
the application process. So before this

**‚è∞ 00:39:49**
the application process. So before this I was I did my bachelors in electrical

**‚è∞ 00:39:52**
I was I did my bachelors in electrical

**‚è∞ 00:39:52**
I was I did my bachelors in electrical engineering and then I did the masters

**‚è∞ 00:39:55**
engineering and then I did the masters

**‚è∞ 00:39:55**
engineering and then I did the masters in uh AI. So, but what I want to

**‚è∞ 00:39:59**
in uh AI. So, but what I want to

**‚è∞ 00:39:59**
in uh AI. So, but what I want to highlight here is that when doing the

**‚è∞ 00:40:03**
highlight here is that when doing the

**‚è∞ 00:40:03**
highlight here is that when doing the application and you find like you have

**‚è∞ 00:40:05**
application and you find like you have

**‚è∞ 00:40:05**
application and you find like you have to do the personal statement and the

**‚è∞ 00:40:07**
to do the personal statement and the

**‚è∞ 00:40:07**
to do the personal statement and the video, you don't need to be intimidated

**‚è∞ 00:40:11**
video, you don't need to be intimidated

**‚è∞ 00:40:11**
video, you don't need to be intimidated by

**‚è∞ 00:40:12**
by

**‚è∞ 00:40:12**
by quote unquote the lack of of experience

**‚è∞ 00:40:14**
quote unquote the lack of of experience

**‚è∞ 00:40:14**
quote unquote the lack of of experience or research experience you have here. Uh

**‚è∞ 00:40:17**
or research experience you have here. Uh

**‚è∞ 00:40:17**
or research experience you have here. Uh so you try try to think of what you have

**‚è∞ 00:40:20**
so you try try to think of what you have

**‚è∞ 00:40:20**
so you try try to think of what you have done and why you are interested in this

**‚è∞ 00:40:22**
done and why you are interested in this

**‚è∞ 00:40:22**
done and why you are interested in this program and what you want to do and

**‚è∞ 00:40:25**
program and what you want to do and

**‚è∞ 00:40:25**
program and what you want to do and really use the personal statement and

**‚è∞ 00:40:27**
really use the personal statement and

**‚è∞ 00:40:27**
really use the personal statement and the video as a chance to showcase how

like another potential um direction. Um and so I had read through a bunch of the

**‚è∞ 00:43:25**
and so I had read through a bunch of the

**‚è∞ 00:43:25**
and so I had read through a bunch of the papers even before like applying to the

**‚è∞ 00:43:27**
papers even before like applying to the

**‚è∞ 00:43:27**
papers even before like applying to the program I had. Um and I had a few

**‚è∞ 00:43:30**
program I had. Um and I had a few

**‚è∞ 00:43:30**
program I had. Um and I had a few different ones selected that I had

**‚è∞ 00:43:32**
different ones selected that I had

**‚è∞ 00:43:32**
different ones selected that I had potential answers for. Um, but I think I

**‚è∞ 00:43:36**
potential answers for. Um, but I think I

**‚è∞ 00:43:36**
potential answers for. Um, but I think I like spent too long like,

**‚è∞ 00:43:38**
like spent too long like,

**‚è∞ 00:43:38**
like spent too long like, you know, like what's the perfect one

**‚è∞ 00:43:40**
you know, like what's the perfect one

**‚è∞ 00:43:40**
you know, like what's the perfect one for me to choose and whatever. Um, and

**‚è∞ 00:43:43**
for me to choose and whatever. Um, and

**‚è∞ 00:43:43**
for me to choose and whatever. Um, and it got to the point where I was

**‚è∞ 00:43:45**
it got to the point where I was

**‚è∞ 00:43:45**
it got to the point where I was traveling and I didn't have time to like

**‚è∞ 00:43:47**
traveling and I didn't have time to like

changed your views and research? I think it's hard to overestimate how this

**‚è∞ 00:45:47**
it's hard to overestimate how this

**‚è∞ 00:45:47**
it's hard to overestimate how this program have changed my views and my uh

**‚è∞ 00:45:51**
program have changed my views and my uh

**‚è∞ 00:45:51**
program have changed my views and my uh like trust in my skills and reliability

**‚è∞ 00:45:53**
like trust in my skills and reliability

**‚è∞ 00:45:53**
like trust in my skills and reliability in doing research. Uh because as it has

**‚è∞ 00:45:57**
in doing research. Uh because as it has

**‚è∞ 00:45:57**
in doing research. Uh because as it has been said quite sometimes now it's a

**‚è∞ 00:45:58**
been said quite sometimes now it's a

**‚è∞ 00:45:58**
been said quite sometimes now it's a very intense program uh with a goal of

**‚è∞ 00:46:01**
very intense program uh with a goal of

**‚è∞ 00:46:02**
very intense program uh with a goal of like after uh uh six or seven months you

**‚è∞ 00:46:05**
like after uh uh six or seven months you

**‚è∞ 00:46:05**
like after uh uh six or seven months you will be writing a paper to be uh

**‚è∞ 00:46:08**
will be writing a paper to be uh

**‚è∞ 00:46:08**
will be writing a paper to be uh submitted to one of the top conference

**‚è∞ 00:46:10**
submitted to one of the top conference

**‚è∞ 00:46:10**
submitted to one of the top conference in AI. uh and throughout this process

**‚è∞ 00:46:13**
in AI. uh and throughout this process

**‚è∞ 00:46:13**
in AI. uh and throughout this process you do research rig uh rigorously and

**‚è∞ 00:46:16**
you do research rig uh rigorously and

**‚è∞ 00:46:16**
you do research rig uh rigorously and you do have lots of re lots of compute

**‚è∞ 00:46:19**
you do have lots of re lots of compute

**‚è∞ 00:46:19**
you do have lots of re lots of compute and lots of great uh mentors. So it's

**‚è∞ 00:46:23**
and lots of great uh mentors. So it's

**‚è∞ 00:46:23**
and lots of great uh mentors. So it's as good as it can gets in terms of

**‚è∞ 00:46:26**
as good as it can gets in terms of

**‚è∞ 00:46:26**
as good as it can gets in terms of research for new entry uh uh researchers

**‚è∞ 00:46:29**
research for new entry uh uh researchers

**‚è∞ 00:46:29**
research for new entry uh uh researchers and newcomers. So I think this program

**‚è∞ 00:46:33**
and newcomers. So I think this program

**‚è∞ 00:46:33**
and newcomers. So I think this program is really like uh fundamental

**‚è∞ 00:46:37**
is really like uh fundamental

**‚è∞ 00:46:37**
is really like uh fundamental fundamental in the way that I am as a

**‚è∞ 00:46:40**
fundamental in the way that I am as a

**‚è∞ 00:46:40**
fundamental in the way that I am as a researcher now. And yeah, if I have any

**‚è∞ 00:46:43**
researcher now. And yeah, if I have any

**‚è∞ 00:46:43**
researcher now. And yeah, if I have any advice for newcomers again uh just try

**‚è∞ 00:46:47**
advice for newcomers again uh just try

**‚è∞ 00:46:47**
advice for newcomers again uh just try when you

**‚è∞ 00:46:49**
when you

**‚è∞ 00:46:49**
when you communicate your research interest and

**‚è∞ 00:46:51**
communicate your research interest and

**‚è∞ 00:46:51**
communicate your research interest and what you want to do in your uh scores in

**‚è∞ 00:46:54**
what you want to do in your uh scores in

**‚è∞ 00:46:54**
what you want to do in your uh scores in your personal statement for the scores

**‚è∞ 00:46:56**
your personal statement for the scores

**‚è∞ 00:46:56**
your personal statement for the scores program. Just try to uh dig deep and

**‚è∞ 00:46:59**
program. Just try to uh dig deep and

**‚è∞ 00:47:00**
program. Just try to uh dig deep and think about it a lot and write it very

**‚è∞ 00:47:01**
think about it a lot and write it very

**‚è∞ 00:47:01**
think about it a lot and write it very clearly and be very explicit about what

standout personal statement and also it will be helpful in how you get matched

**‚è∞ 00:47:11**
will be helpful in how you get matched

**‚è∞ 00:47:11**
will be helpful in how you get matched with different mentors as the program uh

**‚è∞ 00:47:13**
with different mentors as the program uh

**‚è∞ 00:47:13**
with different mentors as the program uh begins and how you go through your

**‚è∞ 00:47:15**
begins and how you go through your

**‚è∞ 00:47:16**
begins and how you go through your research. Yeah.

**‚è∞ 00:47:22**
&gt;&gt; Thanks. I think another quick one,

**‚è∞ 00:47:24**
&gt;&gt; Thanks. I think another quick one,

**‚è∞ 00:47:24**
&gt;&gt; Thanks. I think another quick one, Marzia, there's lots of people asking

**‚è∞ 00:47:26**
Marzia, there's lots of people asking

**‚è∞ 00:47:26**
Marzia, there's lots of people asking how many scholars. Um, we typically

**‚è∞ 00:47:28**
how many scholars. Um, we typically

**‚è∞ 00:47:28**
how many scholars. Um, we typically accept anywhere from 5 to 10 scholars

**‚è∞ 00:47:30**
accept anywhere from 5 to 10 scholars

**‚è∞ 00:47:30**
accept anywhere from 5 to 10 scholars per cohort each year. That's what we've

**‚è∞ 00:47:32**
per cohort each year. That's what we've

**‚è∞ 00:47:32**
per cohort each year. That's what we've done the last three years. Um, and this

**‚è∞ 00:47:35**
done the last three years. Um, and this

**‚è∞ 00:47:35**
done the last three years. Um, and this cohort will be somewhere within that

**‚è∞ 00:47:37**
cohort will be somewhere within that

**‚è∞ 00:47:37**
cohort will be somewhere within that same range. So, I just wanted to address

**‚è∞ 00:47:38**
same range. So, I just wanted to address

**‚è∞ 00:47:38**
same range. So, I just wanted to address that one really quickly because I know

**‚è∞ 00:47:39**
that one really quickly because I know

**‚è∞ 00:47:40**
that one really quickly because I know lots of people are curious about that in

**‚è∞ 00:47:41**
lots of people are curious about that in

**‚è∞ 00:47:41**
lots of people are curious about that in the Q&amp;A.

**‚è∞ 00:47:52**
I think someone else also asked about

**‚è∞ 00:47:54**
I think someone else also asked about

**‚è∞ 00:47:54**
I think someone else also asked about will rejected applications get feedback.

**‚è∞ 00:47:56**
will rejected applications get feedback.

**‚è∞ 00:47:56**
will rejected applications get feedback. Unfortunately, due to the volume of

**‚è∞ 00:47:58**
Unfortunately, due to the volume of

**‚è∞ 00:47:58**
Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications, no, we will not be able to

**‚è∞ 00:48:00**
applications, no, we will not be able to

**‚è∞ 00:48:00**
applications, no, we will not be able to provide feedback.

**‚è∞ 00:48:02**
provide feedback.

**‚è∞ 00:48:02**
provide feedback. Um, I'm just trying to go through any

**‚è∞ 00:48:04**
Um, I'm just trying to go through any

**‚è∞ 00:48:04**
Um, I'm just trying to go through any other quick ones. Marzia or Amomar or

Diana, if you see any other quick ones or we can jump to a more in-depth one.

**‚è∞ 00:48:10**
or we can jump to a more in-depth one.

**‚è∞ 00:48:10**
or we can jump to a more in-depth one. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I see one here asking about

**‚è∞ 00:48:14**
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I see one here asking about

**‚è∞ 00:48:14**
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I see one here asking about the journals that we'll be submitting.

**‚è∞ 00:48:16**
the journals that we'll be submitting.

**‚è∞ 00:48:16**
the journals that we'll be submitting. Again, it will be depending on your

Again, it will be depending on your research and at the time that you're

**‚è∞ 00:48:20**
research and at the time that you're

**‚è∞ 00:48:20**
research and at the time that you're submitting, but it's definitely one of

**‚è∞ 00:48:23**
submitting, but it's definitely one of

**‚è∞ 00:48:23**
submitting, but it's definitely one of the top conference in machine learning

**‚è∞ 00:48:25**
the top conference in machine learning

**‚è∞ 00:48:25**
the top conference in machine learning that what will always be targeted.

**‚è∞ 00:48:30**
Uh

**‚è∞ 00:48:32**
Uh

**‚è∞ 00:48:32**
Uh &gt;&gt; yeah, I mean the the number of

**‚è∞ 00:48:34**
&gt;&gt; yeah, I mean the the number of

**‚è∞ 00:48:34**
&gt;&gt; yeah, I mean the the number of applications is just from the people on

**‚è∞ 00:48:37**
applications is just from the people on

**‚è∞ 00:48:37**
applications is just from the people on this call, you can just guess like

**‚è∞ 00:48:39**
this call, you can just guess like

**‚è∞ 00:48:39**
this call, you can just guess like there's a it's a very uh uh and for good

**‚è∞ 00:48:42**
there's a it's a very uh uh and for good

**‚è∞ 00:48:42**
there's a it's a very uh uh and for good reason because this is the fourth year

**‚è∞ 00:48:45**
reason because this is the fourth year

**‚è∞ 00:48:45**
reason because this is the fourth year and we really uh have shown how

**‚è∞ 00:48:49**
and we really uh have shown how

**‚è∞ 00:48:49**
and we really uh have shown how impactful this program and the

**‚è∞ 00:48:51**
impactful this program and the

**‚è∞ 00:48:51**
impactful this program and the researchers that we discover in this

**‚è∞ 00:48:53**
researchers that we discover in this

**‚è∞ 00:48:53**
researchers that we discover in this program can be. Uh so we we we see how

**‚è∞ 00:48:57**
program can be. Uh so we we we see how

**‚è∞ 00:48:57**
program can be. Uh so we we we see how many applications we get this year. Um

**‚è∞ 00:49:00**
many applications we get this year. Um

**‚è∞ 00:49:00**
many applications we get this year. Um uh but yeah it is very competitive and

**‚è∞ 00:49:03**
uh but yeah it is very competitive and

**‚è∞ 00:49:03**
uh but yeah it is very competitive and uh we have a very high bar to select the

**‚è∞ 00:49:05**
uh we have a very high bar to select the

**‚è∞ 00:49:05**
uh we have a very high bar to select the final candidates.

**‚è∞ 00:49:17**
Uh there's a question about whether the

**‚è∞ 00:49:20**
Uh there's a question about whether the

**‚è∞ 00:49:20**
Uh there's a question about whether the forms and videos are evaluated manually

**‚è∞ 00:49:22**
forms and videos are evaluated manually

**‚è∞ 00:49:22**
forms and videos are evaluated manually or AI based evaluation. Everything is

**‚è∞ 00:49:25**
or AI based evaluation. Everything is

**‚è∞ 00:49:25**
or AI based evaluation. Everything is done manually by multiple people. People

done manually by multiple people. People on this call, people behind the scenes.

**‚è∞ 00:49:32**
on this call, people behind the scenes.

**‚è∞ 00:49:32**
on this call, people behind the scenes. I don't think we trust our AI systems

**‚è∞ 00:49:35**
I don't think we trust our AI systems

**‚è∞ 00:49:36**
I don't think we trust our AI systems this far. I think we still really want

**‚è∞ 00:49:38**
this far. I think we still really want

**‚è∞ 00:49:38**
this far. I think we still really want to Yeah, there's some things that you

**‚è∞ 00:49:41**
to Yeah, there's some things that you

**‚è∞ 00:49:41**
to Yeah, there's some things that you don't really you cannot really do

**‚è∞ 00:49:43**
don't really you cannot really do

**‚è∞ 00:49:43**
don't really you cannot really do automatically. So uh even checking the

**‚è∞ 00:49:47**
automatically. So uh even checking the

**‚è∞ 00:49:47**
automatically. So uh even checking the uh the CVs uh the individual questions

**‚è∞ 00:49:49**
uh the CVs uh the individual questions

**‚è∞ 00:49:49**
uh the CVs uh the individual questions the individual videos statements

**‚è∞ 00:49:52**
the individual videos statements

**‚è∞ 00:49:52**
the individual videos statements everything we go through every

**‚è∞ 00:49:53**
everything we go through every

**‚è∞ 00:49:53**
everything we go through every application

**‚è∞ 00:49:55**
application

**‚è∞ 00:49:55**
application um ourselves.

**‚è∞ 00:50:03**
Yeah I I've seen a few questions about

**‚è∞ 00:50:06**
Yeah I I've seen a few questions about

**‚è∞ 00:50:06**
Yeah I I've seen a few questions about visa sponsorship. So unfortunately we

**‚è∞ 00:50:08**
visa sponsorship. So unfortunately we

**‚è∞ 00:50:08**
visa sponsorship. So unfortunately we don't provide any sponsorship. So um

**‚è∞ 00:50:12**
don't provide any sponsorship. So um

**‚è∞ 00:50:12**
don't provide any sponsorship. So um ideally you have to be able to uh this

**‚è∞ 00:50:15**
ideally you have to be able to uh this

**‚è∞ 00:50:15**
ideally you have to be able to uh this is remote first so where you are living

**‚è∞ 00:50:18**
is remote first so where you are living

**‚è∞ 00:50:18**
is remote first so where you are living uh you can join the program uh from

**‚è∞ 00:50:21**
uh you can join the program uh from

**‚è∞ 00:50:21**
uh you can join the program uh from there um but you have to be able to

**‚è∞ 00:50:24**
there um but you have to be able to

**‚è∞ 00:50:24**
there um but you have to be able to leave where where you are so uh we we

**‚è∞ 00:50:27**
leave where where you are so uh we we

**‚è∞ 00:50:27**
leave where where you are so uh we we wouldn't be able to provide any

**‚è∞ 00:50:29**
wouldn't be able to provide any

**‚è∞ 00:50:29**
wouldn't be able to provide any sponsorship.

**‚è∞ 00:50:36**
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I've also seen one question I

**‚è∞ 00:50:41**
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I've also seen one question I can't find it again but was about the

**‚è∞ 00:50:43**
can't find it again but was about the

**‚è∞ 00:50:43**
can't find it again but was about the video and if someone can submit a demo

**‚è∞ 00:50:45**
video and if someone can submit a demo

**‚è∞ 00:50:46**
video and if someone can submit a demo to the video uh I would say uh there is

**‚è∞ 00:50:50**
to the video uh I would say uh there is

**‚è∞ 00:50:50**
to the video uh I would say uh there is a prompt associated with the videos that

**‚è∞ 00:50:51**
a prompt associated with the videos that

**‚è∞ 00:50:51**
a prompt associated with the videos that to talk about the specific paper and

**‚è∞ 00:50:53**
to talk about the specific paper and

**‚è∞ 00:50:53**
to talk about the specific paper and like to discuss way to extend it uh so

**‚è∞ 00:50:56**
like to discuss way to extend it uh so

to a camera in a card like did but I would say like mostly try to stick to

**‚è∞ 00:51:05**
would say like mostly try to stick to

**‚è∞ 00:51:05**
would say like mostly try to stick to what the prompt is defined as to like if

**‚è∞ 00:51:07**
what the prompt is defined as to like if

**‚è∞ 00:51:08**
what the prompt is defined as to like if you want to show other work that you

no that's not the uh uh uh the the goal.

**‚è∞ 00:51:35**
no that's not the uh uh uh the the goal. So we we have research ideas and

**‚è∞ 00:51:38**
So we we have research ideas and

**‚è∞ 00:51:38**
So we we have research ideas and research questions in mind. We are

**‚è∞ 00:51:40**
research questions in mind. We are

**‚è∞ 00:51:40**
research questions in mind. We are designing proposals for each scholar and

**‚è∞ 00:51:44**
designing proposals for each scholar and

**‚è∞ 00:51:44**
designing proposals for each scholar and uh they will join the project knowing

**‚è∞ 00:51:47**
uh they will join the project knowing

**‚è∞ 00:51:47**
uh they will join the project knowing the the overall goal of the project. How

**‚è∞ 00:51:49**
the the overall goal of the project. How

**‚è∞ 00:51:49**
the the overall goal of the project. How to achieve that? There's something that

**‚è∞ 00:51:51**
to achieve that? There's something that

**‚è∞ 00:51:51**
to achieve that? There's something that is a very collaborative process uh that

**‚è∞ 00:51:54**
is a very collaborative process uh that

**‚è∞ 00:51:54**
is a very collaborative process uh that uh the scholar will do with the the

**‚è∞ 00:51:57**
uh the scholar will do with the the

**‚è∞ 00:51:57**
uh the scholar will do with the the mentors on the project and if they have

**‚è∞ 00:51:59**
mentors on the project and if they have

**‚è∞ 00:51:59**
mentors on the project and if they have worked before on uh something similar

**‚è∞ 00:52:02**
worked before on uh something similar

**‚è∞ 00:52:02**
worked before on uh something similar then yeah that's a nice coincidence but

**‚è∞ 00:52:05**
then yeah that's a nice coincidence but

**‚è∞ 00:52:05**
then yeah that's a nice coincidence but it definitely doesn't have to be and

**‚è∞ 00:52:07**
it definitely doesn't have to be and

**‚è∞ 00:52:07**
it definitely doesn't have to be and it's not going to be uh related to your

**‚è∞ 00:52:10**
it's not going to be uh related to your

**‚è∞ 00:52:10**
it's not going to be uh related to your previous portfolio.

**‚è∞ 00:52:22**
There's a lot of questions or a couple

**‚è∞ 00:52:24**
There's a lot of questions or a couple

**‚è∞ 00:52:24**
There's a lot of questions or a couple questions here about sort of what

**‚è∞ 00:52:25**
questions here about sort of what

**‚è∞ 00:52:25**
questions here about sort of what happens after the scholar program which

**‚è∞ 00:52:27**
happens after the scholar program which

**‚è∞ 00:52:27**
happens after the scholar program which is funny because we haven't started the

**‚è∞ 00:52:28**
is funny because we haven't started the

**‚è∞ 00:52:28**
is funny because we haven't started the scholar program yet but people are like

**‚è∞ 00:52:30**
scholar program yet but people are like

**‚è∞ 00:52:30**
scholar program yet but people are like what happens at the end um and I know we

**‚è∞ 00:52:32**
what happens at the end um and I know we

**‚è∞ 00:52:32**
what happens at the end um and I know we briefly talked about it um you know on a

**‚è∞ 00:52:34**
briefly talked about it um you know on a

**‚è∞ 00:52:34**
briefly talked about it um you know on a slide here I think it's really your

**‚è∞ 00:52:36**
slide here I think it's really your

**‚è∞ 00:52:36**
slide here I think it's really your journey right some people do this

**‚è∞ 00:52:38**
journey right some people do this

**‚è∞ 00:52:38**
journey right some people do this program and say I want to go on to do a

**‚è∞ 00:52:40**
program and say I want to go on to do a

**‚è∞ 00:52:40**
program and say I want to go on to do a PhD um some people end up getting

**‚è∞ 00:52:42**
PhD um some people end up getting

**‚è∞ 00:52:42**
PhD um some people end up getting full-time roles at um you know other

**‚è∞ 00:52:45**
full-time roles at um you know other

**‚è∞ 00:52:45**
full-time roles at um you know other other big companies. Some people end up

**‚è∞ 00:52:47**
other big companies. Some people end up

**‚è∞ 00:52:47**
other big companies. Some people end up getting roles at Coher and or Coher

**‚è∞ 00:52:50**
getting roles at Coher and or Coher

**‚è∞ 00:52:50**
getting roles at Coher and or Coher Labs. Um, so I think it really just

**‚è∞ 00:52:52**
Labs. Um, so I think it really just

**‚è∞ 00:52:52**
Labs. Um, so I think it really just depends on your journey and what you end

**‚è∞ 00:52:54**
depends on your journey and what you end

**‚è∞ 00:52:54**
depends on your journey and what you end up researching and sort of your

**‚è∞ 00:52:56**
up researching and sort of your

**‚è∞ 00:52:56**
up researching and sort of your experience. I think everyone everyone's

**‚è∞ 00:52:58**
experience. I think everyone everyone's

**‚è∞ 00:52:58**
experience. I think everyone everyone's end journey here has been a little

**‚è∞ 00:53:00**
end journey here has been a little

**‚è∞ 00:53:00**
end journey here has been a little different. Um, all really cool to see.

**‚è∞ 00:53:02**
different. Um, all really cool to see.

**‚è∞ 00:53:02**
different. Um, all really cool to see. Um, but yeah, I think it it really just

**‚è∞ 00:53:04**
Um, but yeah, I think it it really just

**‚è∞ 00:53:04**
Um, but yeah, I think it it really just depends on what your goals are um, you

**‚è∞ 00:53:07**
depends on what your goals are um, you

**‚è∞ 00:53:07**
depends on what your goals are um, you know, after the program and and sort of

**‚è∞ 00:53:08**
know, after the program and and sort of

**‚è∞ 00:53:08**
know, after the program and and sort of long term.

**‚è∞ 00:53:11**
long term.

**‚è∞ 00:53:11**
long term. Amomar or Diana, do you want to add

**‚è∞ 00:53:13**
Amomar or Diana, do you want to add

**‚è∞ 00:53:13**
Amomar or Diana, do you want to add anything to that to like what happens at

**‚è∞ 00:53:15**
anything to that to like what happens at

**‚è∞ 00:53:15**
anything to that to like what happens at the end?

**‚è∞ 00:53:17**
the end?

**‚è∞ 00:53:17**
the end? &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. I think I would just say like

**‚è∞ 00:53:21**
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. I think I would just say like

**‚è∞ 00:53:21**
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. I think I would just say like as you're approaching the end of the

**‚è∞ 00:53:23**
as you're approaching the end of the

**‚è∞ 00:53:23**
as you're approaching the end of the program and throughout the program, your

**‚è∞ 00:53:24**
program and throughout the program, your

**‚è∞ 00:53:24**
program and throughout the program, your mentor is always there to help you. Even

**‚è∞ 00:53:26**
mentor is always there to help you. Even

**‚è∞ 00:53:26**
mentor is always there to help you. Even if you're not sure what you're going to

**‚è∞ 00:53:27**
if you're not sure what you're going to

**‚è∞ 00:53:27**
if you're not sure what you're going to do about it, you have all the time to

**‚è∞ 00:53:29**
do about it, you have all the time to

**‚è∞ 00:53:29**
do about it, you have all the time to think about it throughout the program.

**‚è∞ 00:53:31**
think about it throughout the program.

**‚è∞ 00:53:31**
think about it throughout the program. Yeah. And what you see?

**‚è∞ 00:53:35**
Yeah. And what you see?

**‚è∞ 00:53:35**
Yeah. And what you see? Uh I also saw one or two questions about

**‚è∞ 00:53:38**
Uh I also saw one or two questions about

**‚è∞ 00:53:38**
Uh I also saw one or two questions about if not selected what advice or

**‚è∞ 00:53:40**
if not selected what advice or

**‚è∞ 00:53:40**
if not selected what advice or suggestion would you give to a person

**‚è∞ 00:53:43**
suggestion would you give to a person

**‚è∞ 00:53:43**
suggestion would you give to a person and uh I might put Diana on the spot for

**‚è∞ 00:53:47**
and uh I might put Diana on the spot for

**‚è∞ 00:53:47**
and uh I might put Diana on the spot for this one but I think also just like

**‚è∞ 00:53:49**
this one but I think also just like

**‚è∞ 00:53:49**
this one but I think also just like adding my two cent it really depends on

**‚è∞ 00:53:52**
adding my two cent it really depends on

**‚è∞ 00:53:52**
adding my two cent it really depends on what you want to do in your career and

**‚è∞ 00:53:56**
what you want to do in your career and

**‚è∞ 00:53:56**
what you want to do in your career and how you want to go about this. So this

**‚è∞ 00:53:59**
how you want to go about this. So this

**‚è∞ 00:53:59**
how you want to go about this. So this is this part program is going to be very

**‚è∞ 00:54:01**
is this part program is going to be very

**‚è∞ 00:54:01**
is this part program is going to be very competitive and not getting selected

**‚è∞ 00:54:03**
competitive and not getting selected

**‚è∞ 00:54:03**
competitive and not getting selected doesn't mean the end of the world. There

**‚è∞ 00:54:05**
doesn't mean the end of the world. There

**‚è∞ 00:54:05**
doesn't mean the end of the world. There are different ways to still if you're

**‚è∞ 00:54:07**
are different ways to still if you're

**‚è∞ 00:54:07**
are different ways to still if you're interested to work with co labs becoming

**‚è∞ 00:54:10**
interested to work with co labs becoming

**‚è∞ 00:54:10**
interested to work with co labs becoming part of the community and working on

**‚è∞ 00:54:12**
part of the community and working on

**‚è∞ 00:54:12**
part of the community and working on different initiatives that we launch

**‚è∞ 00:54:15**
different initiatives that we launch

**‚è∞ 00:54:15**
different initiatives that we launch there. That's one way of doing that. And

**‚è∞ 00:54:17**
there. That's one way of doing that. And

**‚è∞ 00:54:17**
there. That's one way of doing that. And then there's always next year uh as I

**‚è∞ 00:54:20**
then there's always next year uh as I

**‚è∞ 00:54:20**
then there's always next year uh as I think Diana would tell you. Uh and yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:54:23**
think Diana would tell you. Uh and yeah,

**‚è∞ 00:54:23**
think Diana would tell you. Uh and yeah, you never know. There's always going to

**‚è∞ 00:54:25**
you never know. There's always going to

**‚è∞ 00:54:25**
you never know. There's always going to be other opportunities as well.

**‚è∞ 00:54:28**
be other opportunities as well.

**‚è∞ 00:54:28**
be other opportunities as well. Yeah, I can jump in here and say that I

**‚è∞ 00:54:31**
Yeah, I can jump in here and say that I

**‚è∞ 00:54:31**
Yeah, I can jump in here and say that I applied three times. Um I got in on my

**‚è∞ 00:54:34**
applied three times. Um I got in on my

**‚è∞ 00:54:34**
applied three times. Um I got in on my third time, but that's like uh two two

**‚è∞ 00:54:37**
third time, but that's like uh two two

**‚è∞ 00:54:37**
third time, but that's like uh two two years I applied and I didn't get in,

**‚è∞ 00:54:38**
years I applied and I didn't get in,

**‚è∞ 00:54:38**
years I applied and I didn't get in, right? Um so uh definitely like that's

**‚è∞ 00:54:42**
right? Um so uh definitely like that's

**‚è∞ 00:54:42**
right? Um so uh definitely like that's something that's valued. If you like

**‚è∞ 00:54:44**
something that's valued. If you like

**‚è∞ 00:54:44**
something that's valued. If you like apply multiple times, it shows that you

**‚è∞ 00:54:46**
apply multiple times, it shows that you

**‚è∞ 00:54:46**
apply multiple times, it shows that you have sustained interest and you're also

**‚è∞ 00:54:49**
have sustained interest and you're also

**‚è∞ 00:54:49**
have sustained interest and you're also um resilient. Uh so I would definitely

just just go ahead and do it. Um but

**‚è∞ 00:54:59**
just just go ahead and do it. Um but this you know doesn't have to be um the

**‚è∞ 00:55:01**
this you know doesn't have to be um the

**‚è∞ 00:55:01**
this you know doesn't have to be um the only avenue towards getting into uh

**‚è∞ 00:55:03**
only avenue towards getting into uh

**‚è∞ 00:55:03**
only avenue towards getting into uh research. It's that it definitely helps

**‚è∞ 00:55:05**
research. It's that it definitely helps

**‚è∞ 00:55:05**
research. It's that it definitely helps um so much but um as Marzia said the

**‚è∞ 00:55:08**
um so much but um as Marzia said the

**‚è∞ 00:55:08**
um so much but um as Marzia said the community if anyone's not in it yet um

**‚è∞ 00:55:11**
community if anyone's not in it yet um

**‚è∞ 00:55:11**
community if anyone's not in it yet um it's a really incredible resource.

**‚è∞ 00:55:12**
it's a really incredible resource.

**‚è∞ 00:55:20**
groups where people um discuss various

**‚è∞ 00:55:20**
groups where people um discuss various uh areas of research. Um I personally

**‚è∞ 00:55:23**
uh areas of research. Um I personally

**‚è∞ 00:55:23**
uh areas of research. Um I personally was involved in the YA project which

**‚è∞ 00:55:25**
was involved in the YA project which

**‚è∞ 00:55:25**
was involved in the YA project which some of you may be familiar with as

**‚è∞ 00:55:26**
some of you may be familiar with as

**‚è∞ 00:55:26**
some of you may be familiar with as well. Um but that was this like

**‚è∞ 00:55:28**
well. Um but that was this like

**‚è∞ 00:55:28**
well. Um but that was this like tremendous initiative um to gather data

**‚è∞ 00:55:30**
tremendous initiative um to gather data

**‚è∞ 00:55:30**
tremendous initiative um to gather data from all across the world. Um so there's

**‚è∞ 00:55:33**
from all across the world. Um so there's

**‚è∞ 00:55:33**
from all across the world. Um so there's a lot of community opportunities there.

wrap up and I know a lot of questions are still there and maybe we can share

**‚è∞ 00:56:16**
are still there and maybe we can share

**‚è∞ 00:56:16**
are still there and maybe we can share some links for uh answers later. But for

**‚è∞ 00:56:19**
some links for uh answers later. But for

**‚è∞ 00:56:19**
some links for uh answers later. But for you too, what was the most surprising
