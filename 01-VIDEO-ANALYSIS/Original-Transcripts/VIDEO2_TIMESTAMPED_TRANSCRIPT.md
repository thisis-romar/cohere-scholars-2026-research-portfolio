[00:00] Afternoon. [Music]
[00:03] [Music] Welcome everyone. Um I'm really excited
[00:06] Welcome everyone. Um I'm really excited to um kick off our Coher Lab scholars
[00:09] to um kick off our Coher Lab scholars program info session today. Um so as
[00:11] program info session today. Um so as some of you know this is our fourth time
[00:13] some of you know this is our fourth time hosting this our fourth cohort that
[00:15] hosting this our fourth cohort that we'll get ready to welcome um in 2026.
[00:17] we'll get ready to welcome um in 2026. So yeah, I'm excited to kick us off
[00:19] So yeah, I'm excited to kick us off today. Um let's go to the next slide. So
[00:22] today. Um let's go to the next slide. So today you'll hear from myself. I'm on
[00:24] today you'll hear from myself. I'm on the operations team at Coher Labs.
[00:25] the operations team at Coher Labs. You'll hear from Marzia who graciously
[00:27] You'll hear from Marzia who graciously just jumped in and shared her slides for
[00:29] just jumped in and shared her slides for us. Um she's one of our staff research
[00:31] us. Um she's one of our staff research scientists here at Coher Labs. And then
[00:34] scientists here at Coher Labs. And then I'm also really excited that we have
[00:35] I'm also really excited that we have Diana and Amar here today. Um Diana and
[00:38] Diana and Amar here today. Um Diana and Amar are both current scholars at Coher
[00:40] Amar are both current scholars at Coher Labs and they've been with us since
[00:41] Labs and they've been with us since January. So we'll hear from them a bit
[00:43] January. So we'll hear from them a bit later in the call. Um but yeah, I'm
[00:45] later in the call. Um but yeah, I'm excited to um have everyone here today.
[00:48] excited to um have everyone here today. Um let's see. So just a little bit of an
[00:51] Um let's see. So just a little bit of an agenda and then some housekeeping on how
[00:53] agenda and then some housekeeping on how we'll sort of run this call today. We'll
[00:55] we'll sort of run this call today. We'll start with a quick overview of Coher
[00:57] start with a quick overview of Coher Labs. We'll talk about the scholars
[00:59] Labs. We'll talk about the scholars program sort of in general and as a
[01:01] program sort of in general and as a whole, and then we'll zoom in a bit and
[01:03] whole, and then we'll zoom in a bit and talk about the application, the
[01:04] talk about the application, the different parts of the application, some
[01:06] different parts of the application, some tips, where to go to find more tips. Um,
[01:09] tips, where to go to find more tips. Um, and then you'll hear from our current
[01:10] and then you'll hear from our current scholars, like I mentioned, Diana and
[01:12] scholars, like I mentioned, Diana and Amar, and then lastly, we'll try to save
[01:14] Amar, and then lastly, we'll try to save about the last half of this call or so
[01:15] about the last half of this call or so for Q&amp;A. Um, and speaking of Q&amp;A, we're
[01:18] for Q&amp;A. Um, and speaking of Q&amp;A, we're going to use the Q&amp;A function. And some
[01:20] going to use the Q&amp;A function. And some people jumped on this call early with me
[01:22] people jumped on this call early with me and tested the Q&amp;A. So, thank you to all
[01:25] and tested the Q&amp;A. So, thank you to all of you that were here like 10 minutes
[01:27] of you that were here like 10 minutes early and you guys were helping me test.
[01:28] early and you guys were helping me test. I really appreciate that. Um, so you'll
[01:31] I really appreciate that. Um, so you'll see I believe the chat is disabled for
[01:33] see I believe the chat is disabled for you as a participant. Um, but the Q&amp;A
[01:35] you as a participant. Um, but the Q&amp;A function should work for you. So, feel
[01:36] function should work for you. So, feel free to use the Q&amp;A function. Not only
[01:39] free to use the Q&amp;A function. Not only use it, but be you can also upvote. So,
[01:41] use it, but be you can also upvote. So, if you have the same question as
[01:42] if you have the same question as someone, please just upvote it um versus
[01:45] someone, please just upvote it um versus typing it in because I have a feeling
[01:46] typing it in because I have a feeling there'll be lots of questions and it'll
[01:47] there'll be lots of questions and it'll be easier for us to sort of sort through
[01:49] be easier for us to sort of sort through by upvote. So, um yeah. So, we'll use
[01:53] by upvote. So, um yeah. So, we'll use the Q&amp;A and then I think I'm gonna pass
[01:54] the Q&amp;A and then I think I'm gonna pass it over to Marzia. She'll start uh
[01:56] it over to Marzia. She'll start uh she'll kick us off with a little bit of
[01:58] she'll kick us off with a little bit of an intro to Coher Labs.
[02:00] an intro to Coher Labs. Uh yeah, thanks Britannia and welcome
[02:03] Uh yeah, thanks Britannia and welcome everyone. Really exciting to kick off
[02:06] everyone. Really exciting to kick off this session on the scholar program for
[02:09] this session on the scholar program for next year. So for those of you who are
[02:12] next year. So for those of you who are maybe not familiar with who we are, we
[02:14] maybe not familiar with who we are, we are Coher Labs, a research lab at Coher
[02:17] are Coher Labs, a research lab at Coher who uh our uh fundamental goal is uh to
[02:21] who uh our uh fundamental goal is uh to to uh uh work on interesting and
[02:26] to uh uh work on interesting and challenging problems in machine
[02:28] challenging problems in machine learning. We have a uh small team of
[02:31] learning. We have a uh small team of full staff uh who uh have been doing
[02:34] full staff uh who uh have been doing research for the past couple of years.
[02:35] research for the past couple of years. And then we also have other initiatives
[02:38] And then we also have other initiatives uh that I want to go through a little
[02:39] uh that I want to go through a little bit today before getting actually to our
[02:42] bit today before getting actually to our scholar program and and the details
[02:44] scholar program and and the details about that. And our mission our
[02:48] about that. And our mission our northstar is we want to change where how
[02:51] northstar is we want to change where how and by whom research is done and we do
[02:53] and by whom research is done and we do that through four main principles and
[02:56] that through four main principles and pillars. So our open collaborations uh
[02:59] pillars. So our open collaborations uh uh our fundamental research which which
[03:02] uh our fundamental research which which scholar program is uh part of that uh
[03:05] scholar program is uh part of that uh training and development and release of
[03:07] training and development and release of uh state-of-the-art models um to uh help
[03:11] uh state-of-the-art models um to uh help the research community to advance the
[03:13] the research community to advance the technology and also building a community
[03:15] technology and also building a community of researchers. And throughout the past
[03:17] of researchers. And throughout the past couple of years we have been publishing
[03:20] couple of years we have been publishing um more than 100 papers uh collaborating
[03:23] um more than 100 papers uh collaborating with uh multiple institutes across the
[03:25] with uh multiple institutes across the world. And uh you might be familiar with
[03:29] world. And uh you might be familiar with models that we have released. Aya is one
[03:31] models that we have released. Aya is one of our uh uh big release uh big family
[03:34] of our uh uh big release uh big family of models that we release uh
[03:36] of models that we release uh periodically uh different variants and
[03:39] periodically uh different variants and different uh uh more recently we have
[03:43] different uh uh more recently we have worked on IA vision for instance on
[03:45] worked on IA vision for instance on multimodality but also on
[03:46] multimodality but also on multilinguality
[03:48] multilinguality and all of this is through our
[03:51] and all of this is through our commitment to uh doing research and
[03:54] commitment to uh doing research and sharing with the community
[03:56] sharing with the community uh and uh really at the end of the day
[04:00] uh and uh really at the end of the day to share the details of the research
[04:01] to share the details of the research that we do. So, uh we uh have this goal
[04:05] that we do. So, uh we uh have this goal of publishing our uh work. We think it's
[04:09] of publishing our uh work. We think it's really important to advance the field
[04:12] really important to advance the field and um I it might be a little uh uh it's
[04:17] and um I it might be a little uh uh it's becoming less and less that people do
[04:19] becoming less and less that people do that. But I'm very proud that us as a
[04:21] that. But I'm very proud that us as a lab, we still have this commitment to
[04:24] lab, we still have this commitment to publishing papers and sharing our
[04:26] publishing papers and sharing our findings. uh and that's a big part of
[04:29] findings. uh and that's a big part of what we work on and it includes
[04:31] what we work on and it includes different uh topics and different
[04:32] different uh topics and different projects from efficiency to safety to
[04:35] projects from efficiency to safety to generalization
[04:37] generalization uh to policy
[04:39] uh to policy uh but beyond research we also have
[04:42] uh but beyond research we also have other initiatives and that includes our
[04:44] other initiatives and that includes our grant program uh our open science
[04:47] grant program uh our open science community
[04:48] community um and uh different partnerships that uh
[04:51] um and uh different partnerships that uh we uh have throughout the year.
[04:55] we uh have throughout the year. I want to highlight our open science
[04:57] I want to highlight our open science initiative in particular. So I think
[05:00] initiative in particular. So I think many of you are probably part of our
[05:02] many of you are probably part of our community. It has been growing a lot
[05:04] community. It has been growing a lot since we started in uh mid22. Um now
[05:09] since we started in uh mid22. Um now more than 4,500
[05:11] more than 4,500 people are part of this community across
[05:13] people are part of this community across the globe. And we have been uh launching
[05:18] the globe. And we have been uh launching global projects, global uh global
[05:20] global projects, global uh global collaborations throughout the year uh to
[05:23] collaborations throughout the year uh to work with people in our community. But
[05:25] work with people in our community. But also the community is great because they
[05:27] also the community is great because they also have have always been organizing uh
[05:31] also have have always been organizing uh different groups and different uh ways
[05:34] different groups and different uh ways to help each other uh to learn and uh to
[05:39] to help each other uh to learn and uh to uh just it depends on their interest
[05:42] uh just it depends on their interest whether it's like for beginners to get
[05:44] whether it's like for beginners to get into research whether there are
[05:46] into research whether there are particular u niches and uh interests
[05:50] particular u niches and uh interests about like safety or RL or compision
[05:53] about like safety or RL or compision people working together, organizing
[05:56] people working together, organizing talks, organizing reading groups and
[05:58] talks, organizing reading groups and also have been working together to
[06:00] also have been working together to publish papers. So, it's really great if
[06:03] publish papers. So, it's really great if you are looking for finding people who
[06:06] you are looking for finding people who would share your interest in research or
[06:09] would share your interest in research or you are looking for where to start if
[06:11] you are looking for where to start if you want to get to research. I would
[06:12] you want to get to research. I would also recommend joining our uh open
[06:15] also recommend joining our uh open science community. But now, let's get to
[06:18] science community. But now, let's get to the scholar program. So I think the
[06:20] the scholar program. So I think the reason many of you are here today. So
[06:24] reason many of you are here today. So what is our scholar program? Uh and why
[06:27] what is our scholar program? Uh and why are we really committed to this for the
[06:30] are we really committed to this for the fourth year in a row? As you know uh the
[06:34] fourth year in a row? As you know uh the progress in our field in the machine
[06:36] progress in our field in the machine learning field is quite fast and it's
[06:40] learning field is quite fast and it's also becoming more and more difficult
[06:43] also becoming more and more difficult for people who wants to start and wants
[06:46] for people who wants to start and wants to get involved in especially in
[06:48] to get involved in especially in research which means working on cutting
[06:50] research which means working on cutting edge uh unexplored problems to to get
[06:53] edge uh unexplored problems to to get involved because the main reason is that
[06:55] involved because the main reason is that you need access to large uh large scale
[06:59] you need access to large uh large scale experiment setup and that is not
[07:01] experiment setup and that is not something that is really unfortunately
[07:04] something that is really unfortunately available everywhere. And our goal for
[07:07] available everywhere. And our goal for this program is to provide the tools and
[07:12] this program is to provide the tools and the mentorship and uh the path
[07:15] the mentorship and uh the path essentially for those of you who really
[07:19] essentially for those of you who really want to get started who wants to get
[07:21] want to get started who wants to get into research and uh go throughout this
[07:24] into research and uh go throughout this research journey together with you. So
[07:27] research journey together with you. So we are running currently our 2025
[07:30] we are running currently our 2025 research pro uh scholar program. So
[07:32] research pro uh scholar program. So these are our six scholars. Two of them
[07:34] these are our six scholars. Two of them are here today which we uh uh we can
[07:38] are here today which we uh uh we can talk to them later. Uh and uh actually
[07:41] talk to them later. Uh and uh actually some of them have already also published
[07:43] some of them have already also published their work uh that they have been
[07:44] their work uh that they have been working uh for the past couple of
[07:46] working uh for the past couple of months. Some of them are still uh
[07:49] months. Some of them are still uh working on their projects to wrap up to
[07:51] working on their projects to wrap up to publish their work. uh and the uh the
[07:55] publish their work. uh and the uh the scholars have a big support from the uh
[08:00] scholars have a big support from the uh different mentors across the company. So
[08:03] different mentors across the company. So both from Coher Labs and also Cohier
[08:05] both from Coher Labs and also Cohier depending on each project. Uh so they're
[08:07] depending on each project. Uh so they're not really alone in uh working on these
[08:11] not really alone in uh working on these projects. Um and we provide a strong
[08:14] projects. Um and we provide a strong group of mentors uh for for the scholars
[08:17] group of mentors uh for for the scholars throughout the program. And you might be
[08:20] throughout the program. And you might be asking okay what type of projects are
[08:22] asking okay what type of projects are you working on in this uh program? And
[08:25] you working on in this uh program? And here I wanted to highlight a few uh
[08:27] here I wanted to highlight a few uh papers that we've published uh
[08:29] papers that we've published uh throughout the years. So this one uh
[08:32] throughout the years. So this one uh Louisa from uh uh the program two years
[08:35] Louisa from uh uh the program two years ago she uh in this particular work she
[08:39] ago she uh in this particular work she uh worked on uh toxicity mitigation
[08:41] uh worked on uh toxicity mitigation which uh in a multilingual setting which
[08:43] which uh in a multilingual setting which is really challenging and uh she she did
[08:48] is really challenging and uh she she did an excellent job of uh publishing a
[08:50] an excellent job of uh publishing a really nice uh paper on this. uh last
[08:53] really nice uh paper on this. uh last year worked on uh synthetic data for uh
[08:59] year worked on uh synthetic data for uh multilingual models. So in particular
[09:02] multilingual models. So in particular coming up with a new method of uh what
[09:04] coming up with a new method of uh what we call multilingual arbitrage to uh
[09:08] we call multilingual arbitrage to uh expand the pool of data available to
[09:10] expand the pool of data available to train models for different languages
[09:12] train models for different languages using multiple teachers. So really
[09:14] using multiple teachers. So really impactful work and uh which has been
[09:18] impactful work and uh which has been also since then used in different uh uh
[09:22] also since then used in different uh uh real world scenarios of developing
[09:25] real world scenarios of developing models and releasing models. And then uh
[09:28] models and releasing models. And then uh Louisa, another Louisa last year, she uh
[09:32] Louisa, another Louisa last year, she uh looked into how uh synthetic data can
[09:35] looked into how uh synthetic data can actually be a really uh fun way to
[09:39] actually be a really uh fun way to target non-ifferiable objectives and
[09:41] target non-ifferiable objectives and steer model generations towards and when
[09:44] steer model generations towards and when we talk about non-ifferiable objectives
[09:46] we talk about non-ifferiable objectives for instance uh you can think about
[09:48] for instance uh you can think about maybe the length of the generation or
[09:50] maybe the length of the generation or like the tone uh things that are um you
[09:53] like the tone uh things that are um you either have to deal with at preference
[09:56] either have to deal with at preference training but in this particular project
[09:57] training but in this particular project we looked into how to deal with that at
[09:59] we looked into how to deal with that at SFD phase. Uh so yeah just a few works
[10:02] SFD phase. Uh so yeah just a few works to show the types of projects that we
[10:05] to show the types of projects that we work on but definitely if you are
[10:07] work on but definitely if you are curious check out uh the the papers for
[10:11] curious check out uh the the papers for uh the the previous years of the scholar
[10:13] uh the the previous years of the scholar program on our website and I do want to
[10:16] program on our website and I do want to highlight that uh this is a remote first
[10:19] highlight that uh this is a remote first uh program and position. Our lab works
[10:22] uh program and position. Our lab works remotely which I think is really
[10:25] remotely which I think is really important because we believe that talent
[10:28] important because we believe that talent can come from anywhere and we are really
[10:30] can come from anywhere and we are really committed to find and work with people
[10:32] committed to find and work with people from across the world but we also have
[10:35] from across the world but we also have nice opportunities during this program
[10:37] nice opportunities during this program to get together. I think this is a
[10:40] to get together. I think this is a really nice uh chance because a lot of
[10:43] really nice uh chance because a lot of times the scholars are uh quite junior
[10:46] times the scholars are uh quite junior and they can practice their presentation
[10:49] and they can practice their presentation skills um in person when we meet for
[10:52] skills um in person when we meet for instance uh in one of our um office
[10:55] instance uh in one of our um office sites or uh just like uh somewhere in
[10:59] sites or uh just like uh somewhere in the board essentially and they they
[11:01] the board essentially and they they present their work whether in progress
[11:03] present their work whether in progress or done to the rest of the company which
[11:06] or done to the rest of the company which is quite nice. So as part of this
[11:08] is quite nice. So as part of this program there's also this opportunity
[11:10] program there's also this opportunity that we can uh still also meet in person
[11:14] that we can uh still also meet in person and this would be the start of the
[11:17] and this would be the start of the journey of a researcher and uh
[11:20] journey of a researcher and uh definitely not the end. Uh past scholars
[11:24] definitely not the end. Uh past scholars have ended up uh going at different
[11:27] have ended up uh going at different universities to do their PhDs or uh
[11:31] universities to do their PhDs or uh joining different uh companies to
[11:33] joining different uh companies to continue working on this technology. And
[11:36] continue working on this technology. And uh our hope is to provide this
[11:38] uh our hope is to provide this opportunity and this path to to the next
[11:41] opportunity and this path to to the next uh round of scholars. Uh here are some
[11:46] uh round of scholars. Uh here are some more details about uh like exactly what
[11:50] more details about uh like exactly what the program for next year look like. I
[11:52] the program for next year look like. I think Britany do you want to take over
[11:56] think Britany do you want to take over or shall I maybe go through these as
[11:58] or shall I maybe go through these as well?
[11:59] well? Um I think I'll have you go through
[12:01] Um I think I'll have you go through these and then I'll jump in once we talk
[12:02] these and then I'll jump in once we talk about the application if that's okay.
[12:04] about the application if that's okay. Yeah. Uh nice. Yeah, definitely. So,
[12:08] Yeah. Uh nice. Yeah, definitely. So, just to reiterate, this is a full-time
[12:10] just to reiterate, this is a full-time position, remote first paid opportunity.
[12:14] position, remote first paid opportunity. Uh the the plan is to have an
[12:16] Uh the the plan is to have an eight-month uh program starting mid
[12:19] eight-month uh program starting mid January next year. And as I mentioned,
[12:22] January next year. And as I mentioned, we support uh the scholars by providing
[12:26] we support uh the scholars by providing uh uh an in-house mentorship and
[12:29] uh uh an in-house mentorship and research team and also uh dedicated
[12:32] research team and also uh dedicated compute resource and uh just general
[12:36] compute resource and uh just general direction for the project uh and helped
[12:38] direction for the project uh and helped throughout the uh the eight months that
[12:41] throughout the uh the eight months that they worked with us. And really the uh
[12:46] they worked with us. And really the uh what you uh what would be like the best
[12:49] what you uh what would be like the best way to think about this program is and
[12:52] way to think about this program is and to prepare for it is that it's going to
[12:54] to prepare for it is that it's going to be intense. It's going to be really
[12:56] be intense. It's going to be really hard. We are working on difficult open
[12:58] hard. We are working on difficult open problems that are not solved but it's
[13:01] problems that are not solved but it's also going to be very rewarding if you
[13:03] also going to be very rewarding if you are willing to take that chance and take
[13:05] are willing to take that chance and take that commitment. So uh yeah
[13:11] and uh I do want to highlight that this program is a little bit different and
[13:18] program is a little bit different and special because we are in particular
[13:21] special because we are in particular looking for emerging talent and what
[13:23] looking for emerging talent and what this means that you can be an early
[13:25] this means that you can be an early career researcher. You don't necessarily
[13:28] career researcher. You don't necessarily have to have a specific degree uh and
[13:31] have to have a specific degree uh and also you don't have to have uh a
[13:33] also you don't have to have uh a published record before. So if you have
[13:35] published record before. So if you have published paper, it's okay. If you
[13:37] published paper, it's okay. If you haven't, it might even be better because
[13:39] haven't, it might even be better because we really want to provide this
[13:40] we really want to provide this opportunity to early career and junior
[13:44] opportunity to early career and junior researchers who have strong machine
[13:46] researchers who have strong machine learning and engineering skills and want
[13:49] learning and engineering skills and want to get involved in uh research in AI.
[13:54] to get involved in uh research in AI. Uh nice. So the next section is about
[13:56] Uh nice. So the next section is about the application process and what to
[13:59] the application process and what to expect when you apply. So I think I'll
[14:01] expect when you apply. So I think I'll hand off to Britany now.
[14:03] hand off to Britany now. Perfect. Thanks so much Marzia. Um yeah,
[14:06] Perfect. Thanks so much Marzia. Um yeah, so I think let's zoom in a bit and talk
[14:08] so I think let's zoom in a bit and talk about the application to the scholars
[14:10] about the application to the scholars program. So there are three stages in
[14:13] program. So there are three stages in the application process. We are
[14:14] the application process. We are currently in stage one where we're
[14:16] currently in stage one where we're accepting applications include and with
[14:19] accepting applications include and with the application we'll ask you for a
[14:20] the application we'll ask you for a personal statement and a video
[14:21] personal statement and a video submission. So we'll start by digging
[14:24] submission. So we'll start by digging into stage one a bit. Um so as you've
[14:27] into stage one a bit. Um so as you've seen if you've clicked on the link um
[14:29] seen if you've clicked on the link um you've seen the application it looks
[14:30] you've seen the application it looks like this. And again, this will ask you
[14:32] like this. And again, this will ask you when you're submitting your application,
[14:34] when you're submitting your application, it will ask you for both a personal
[14:35] it will ask you for both a personal statement and um a video submission. So,
[14:37] statement and um a video submission. So, we'll talk briefly about both of those
[14:40] we'll talk briefly about both of those um elements of the application. Now, so
[14:42] um elements of the application. Now, so the first thing um we'll talk about the
[14:44] the first thing um we'll talk about the personal statement. So, the personal
[14:46] personal statement. So, the personal statement is really an opportunity for
[14:47] statement is really an opportunity for you to let us know who you are and what
[14:49] you to let us know who you are and what your research goals are. Um, what we're
[14:52] your research goals are. Um, what we're looking for here is ones that stand out
[14:54] looking for here is ones that stand out and ones that talk about specific
[14:56] and ones that talk about specific moments or specific experiences that are
[14:58] moments or specific experiences that are helpful for us to understand your
[15:00] helpful for us to understand your strengths and why this program would be
[15:03] strengths and why this program would be a good fit for you. Um, so just be sure
[15:05] a good fit for you. Um, so just be sure to tailor this to this opportunity and
[15:08] to tailor this to this opportunity and um, yeah, I think you want to give it
[15:10] um, yeah, I think you want to give it some time to revise. Um, revisit it,
[15:12] some time to revise. Um, revisit it, maybe draft it, take a couple hours off,
[15:15] maybe draft it, take a couple hours off, couple days off, come back and then we
[15:17] couple days off, come back and then we also recommend proofreading this. Um,
[15:18] also recommend proofreading this. Um, ask a friend. So, a second opinion could
[15:21] ask a friend. So, a second opinion could really help you get some call out areas
[15:23] really help you get some call out areas where things are maybe unclear or maybe
[15:25] where things are maybe unclear or maybe you should add another example to help
[15:27] you should add another example to help sort of um make your point more clear.
[15:30] sort of um make your point more clear. And then lastly, I think sort of hear
[15:31] And then lastly, I think sort of hear how it reads. Read it out loud. U maybe
[15:34] how it reads. Read it out loud. U maybe read it to a friend, send it to your
[15:35] read it to a friend, send it to your grandma, I don't know, have someone else
[15:37] grandma, I don't know, have someone else listen to it. And um I think having
[15:39] listen to it. And um I think having someone else um review it just kind of
[15:41] someone else um review it just kind of helps you get another perspective and
[15:44] helps you get another perspective and maybe that person can help point things
[15:45] maybe that person can help point things out that are missing or maybe something
[15:47] out that are missing or maybe something sounds awkward or you know maybe some
[15:49] sounds awkward or you know maybe some information is missing.
[15:51] information is missing. Um if we could go to the next slide. So
[15:53] Um if we could go to the next slide. So we do have an example here. I won't read
[15:55] we do have an example here. I won't read this example but we do have an example
[15:57] this example but we do have an example here of a personal statement. And we
[15:59] here of a personal statement. And we also have this available on our notion
[16:01] also have this available on our notion guide. So we'll drop a link to that in
[16:03] guide. So we'll drop a link to that in the chat. Um, but this is a personal
[16:06] the chat. Um, but this is a personal statement we have for somebody that was
[16:07] statement we have for somebody that was applying to a PhD program. So, it is
[16:10] applying to a PhD program. So, it is slightly different, right? This isn't a
[16:11] slightly different, right? This isn't a PhD program, but I think the next slide
[16:13] PhD program, but I think the next slide kind of talks about um yeah, so why why
[16:17] kind of talks about um yeah, so why why does that statement work? Well, even
[16:18] does that statement work? Well, even though it's not for our program
[16:19] though it's not for our program directly, it's for our PhD program, but
[16:21] directly, it's for our PhD program, but it works because it's clear and direct
[16:23] it works because it's clear and direct and it's really specific um to her
[16:26] and it's really specific um to her experience and what she wants to achieve
[16:28] experience and what she wants to achieve and it's specific to the program. I
[16:29] and it's specific to the program. I think that that's another thing we want
[16:31] think that that's another thing we want to highlight. I'm sure you all have
[16:32] to highlight. I'm sure you all have dropped personal statements for other
[16:34] dropped personal statements for other things, but we want to make sure that
[16:35] things, but we want to make sure that this is really tailored to this program
[16:38] this is really tailored to this program specifically. Um the terms are also
[16:41] specifically. Um the terms are also defined in that example and it really
[16:43] defined in that example and it really defines her research interests and shows
[16:45] defines her research interests and shows a reason why why is she passionate about
[16:48] a reason why why is she passionate about um her goals and what she wants to
[16:49] um her goals and what she wants to achieve. Um so yeah I think yeah this is
[16:53] achieve. Um so yeah I think yeah this is a sn a quick snapshot of the research
[16:55] a sn a quick snapshot of the research the personal statement guidelines that
[16:57] the personal statement guidelines that we have and so we'll share that link
[16:59] we have and so we'll share that link again in the chat but um you can check
[17:02] again in the chat but um you can check out that example there. I know you
[17:04] out that example there. I know you probably didn't have time to read that
[17:05] probably didn't have time to read that on that slide so yeah be sure to check
[17:07] on that slide so yeah be sure to check that out. Um next let's talk about the
[17:10] that out. Um next let's talk about the video. I think this is a really big
[17:12] video. I think this is a really big piece of the interview and it's a really
[17:13] piece of the interview and it's a really important piece because we get to see
[17:14] important piece because we get to see you we get to see you face to face and
[17:17] you we get to see you face to face and kind of learn um you know a bit about
[17:20] kind of learn um you know a bit about sort of how you think in terms of
[17:22] sort of how you think in terms of research. So um this prompt is a little
[17:24] research. So um this prompt is a little different this year. So if you're
[17:26] different this year. So if you're reapplying from last year it is a little
[17:27] reapplying from last year it is a little different. So be sure to check out the
[17:29] different. So be sure to check out the prompt. We'll drop the link to that as
[17:30] prompt. We'll drop the link to that as well there. That's also on on the notion
[17:32] well there. That's also on on the notion guide. But the prompt this year is we
[17:34] guide. But the prompt this year is we want you to choose a paper from the list
[17:36] want you to choose a paper from the list provided. And again the list is on the
[17:38] provided. And again the list is on the notion page and talk about um and
[17:41] notion page and talk about um and suggest different directions in which
[17:43] suggest different directions in which that work can be further expanded. So um
[17:47] that work can be further expanded. So um maybe you want to start by start the
[17:49] maybe you want to start by start the video by quickly introducing yourself
[17:52] video by quickly introducing yourself and start by saying which paper you
[17:53] and start by saying which paper you chose and maybe why you chose it. Um
[17:55] chose and maybe why you chose it. Um maybe that's that's an area of interest
[17:57] maybe that's that's an area of interest for you and why is that an area of
[17:59] for you and why is that an area of interest for you. And then I think you
[18:01] interest for you. And then I think you want to spend the majority of the time
[18:04] want to spend the majority of the time of this video talking about the prompt
[18:06] of this video talking about the prompt specifically. I think that that would be
[18:07] specifically. I think that that would be a really big tip from for us. Um video
[18:09] a really big tip from for us. Um video should be 5 minutes and so maybe take
[18:12] should be 5 minutes and so maybe take you know a couple seconds in the
[18:13] you know a couple seconds in the beginning to talk like I said introduce
[18:15] beginning to talk like I said introduce yourself which paper you chose. Um but
[18:18] yourself which paper you chose. Um but yeah we really want you to spend a
[18:19] yeah we really want you to spend a majority of time on the prompt. So the
[18:21] majority of time on the prompt. So the prompt being how can it be further
[18:23] prompt being how can it be further expanded? How can this work? So we know
[18:25] expanded? How can this work? So we know what the paper is about, right? Our lab
[18:26] what the paper is about, right? Our lab wrote the the list of papers and so
[18:29] wrote the the list of papers and so we're not looking for you to come in and
[18:31] we're not looking for you to come in and do a fiveminute overview of the paper.
[18:33] do a fiveminute overview of the paper. Um while that's really cool, that's not
[18:35] Um while that's really cool, that's not what we're looking for. or we know what
[18:36] what we're looking for. or we know what the paper's about. We want you to kind
[18:37] the paper's about. We want you to kind of dig in and talk about how the work in
[18:41] of dig in and talk about how the work in the paper could be further expanded or
[18:43] the paper could be further expanded or um you know how can we build upon what
[18:45] um you know how can we build upon what we what we've you know what we've
[18:48] we what we've you know what we've published here or how can we improve
[18:50] published here or how can we improve upon it um or dig further into it. So I
[18:53] upon it um or dig further into it. So I would just recommend really spending
[18:54] would just recommend really spending your time it's only five minutes which
[18:57] your time it's only five minutes which is quick um spending your five minutes
[18:59] is quick um spending your five minutes really digging into like how we can
[19:01] really digging into like how we can further expand on that. Um, we obviously
[19:04] further expand on that. Um, we obviously recommend watching your video back,
[19:05] recommend watching your video back, ensure the audio is clear. Um, another
[19:08] ensure the audio is clear. Um, another big thing is making sure the sharing
[19:09] big thing is making sure the sharing settings on the link work. So, you can
[19:11] settings on the link work. So, you can submit a video in any form. Google
[19:13] submit a video in any form. Google Drive, YouTube. I think a lot of people
[19:15] Drive, YouTube. I think a lot of people are using Loom I think it's called. Um,
[19:18] are using Loom I think it's called. Um, however you want to submit it, it's
[19:19] however you want to submit it, it's totally fine as long as anyone can view
[19:22] totally fine as long as anyone can view it. Um, and I'd also recommend making
[19:24] it. Um, and I'd also recommend making sure it's not just me who has access or
[19:26] sure it's not just me who has access or just Marzia. I know when we share things
[19:27] just Marzia. I know when we share things on Google, we add, you know, specific
[19:29] on Google, we add, you know, specific viewers. Um there'll be a lot of people
[19:31] viewers. Um there'll be a lot of people reviewing the applications um you know
[19:34] reviewing the applications um you know on our team and so we want to make sure
[19:35] on our team and so we want to make sure that everyone can see your video. Um
[19:38] that everyone can see your video. Um yeah and I think a genuine thoughtful
[19:40] yeah and I think a genuine thoughtful response matters more than perfect
[19:42] response matters more than perfect background. We're not looking for you to
[19:43] background. We're not looking for you to like have a photography studio or
[19:45] like have a photography studio or anything super fancy. Um what really
[19:48] anything super fancy. Um what really matters is the content and how you're
[19:50] matters is the content and how you're thinking about the content and the
[19:51] thinking about the content and the research and how you know what your
[19:53] research and how you know what your thought process is there. Um and then
[19:55] thought process is there. Um and then yeah I think lastly if you want to use
[19:57] yeah I think lastly if you want to use presentation tools you're welcome to.
[19:59] presentation tools you're welcome to. So, if you want to have slides, you can.
[20:00] So, if you want to have slides, you can. Not required, but you can. And then
[20:03] Not required, but you can. And then everything that we just talked about and
[20:04] everything that we just talked about and some further tips are listed on the
[20:07] some further tips are listed on the notion page, which I think is getting
[20:08] notion page, which I think is getting dropped in the chat. So, shout out to
[20:10] dropped in the chat. So, shout out to everyone working behind the scenes with
[20:11] everyone working behind the scenes with the links there. Um, so yeah, we'll go
[20:14] the links there. Um, so yeah, we'll go to the next slide. So, stage two. So,
[20:19] to the next slide. So, stage two. So, um, not everyone will go to this stage.
[20:22] um, not everyone will go to this stage. Um, we will select a handful of
[20:23] Um, we will select a handful of candidates that submit a strong personal
[20:25] candidates that submit a strong personal statement and video to move along to the
[20:27] statement and video to move along to the take-home challenge. This will happen in
[20:29] take-home challenge. This will happen in September. Um just a note that this link
[20:33] September. Um just a note that this link to the um take-home assignment will be
[20:35] to the um take-home assignment will be sent out all at once so that everyone
[20:36] sent out all at once so that everyone will have equal amount of time to work
[20:38] will have equal amount of time to work on the take-home challenge. So if you
[20:40] on the take-home challenge. So if you submit your application today and you're
[20:42] submit your application today and you're like why haven't I got a response um
[20:44] like why haven't I got a response um while we're reviewing applications as
[20:45] while we're reviewing applications as they come in, not everyone will get not
[20:47] they come in, not everyone will get not anyone will get moved on to stage two.
[20:49] anyone will get moved on to stage two. Everyone will get moved on at once. And
[20:50] Everyone will get moved on at once. And so and that will be obviously be a after
[20:52] so and that will be obviously be a after the application deadline closes. So, um,
[20:55] the application deadline closes. So, um, you know, you don't have to panic if
[20:56] you know, you don't have to panic if you're like, am I going to get the
[20:58] you're like, am I going to get the take-home or not? Um, we do still have
[21:00] take-home or not? Um, we do still have two weeks. So, the deadline is two weeks
[21:02] two weeks. So, the deadline is two weeks from today. Um, and then we'll send it
[21:04] from today. Um, and then we'll send it out. And so, yeah, the take-home
[21:06] out. And so, yeah, the take-home challenge is really, there's three parts
[21:07] challenge is really, there's three parts of it. Um, the first part is that we are
[21:10] of it. Um, the first part is that we are really looking for you to showcase your
[21:12] really looking for you to showcase your engineering skills here. So, we want
[21:14] engineering skills here. So, we want you, it'll be um, some sort of mix of
[21:16] you, it'll be um, some sort of mix of identifying bugs and getting the code
[21:18] identifying bugs and getting the code working. and we're just really trying to
[21:20] working. and we're just really trying to test your ability and see your ability
[21:22] test your ability and see your ability um to work on real engineering problems.
[21:25] um to work on real engineering problems. Um it'll also test your ability to
[21:27] Um it'll also test your ability to generate code for a specific problem.
[21:29] generate code for a specific problem. And then lastly, there will be a um
[21:31] And then lastly, there will be a um optional challenge at the end. And if
[21:34] optional challenge at the end. And if you're failing up to it, great. Um if
[21:36] you're failing up to it, great. Um if not, then that's fine, too. But yeah,
[21:38] not, then that's fine, too. But yeah, we're really just looking for a
[21:39] we're really just looking for a practical way for you to demonstrate
[21:40] practical way for you to demonstrate your skills and your capabilities that
[21:43] your skills and your capabilities that you have. So I think yeah, and then so
[21:47] you have. So I think yeah, and then so what happens after that, right? Like
[21:49] what happens after that, right? Like let's say you get through stage one, you
[21:50] let's say you get through stage one, you submit your video, you submit your
[21:51] submit your video, you submit your personal statement, you submit your
[21:53] personal statement, you submit your assignment. What's next? Um so yeah, as
[21:56] assignment. What's next? Um so yeah, as I mentioned, all applications received
[21:58] I mentioned, all applications received by August 29th, which is two weeks from
[21:59] by August 29th, which is two weeks from today. Um will be reviewed as they come
[22:02] today. Um will be reviewed as they come in. The take-home challenge will be um
[22:05] in. The take-home challenge will be um sent to select applicants all at once in
[22:07] sent to select applicants all at once in midepptember. And then we anticipate
[22:09] midepptember. And then we anticipate interviews to be held in October, early
[22:12] interviews to be held in October, early November. And then just continuing on
[22:15] November. And then just continuing on that timeline in mid- November, we plan
[22:17] that timeline in mid- November, we plan to try to make those offers and then the
[22:19] to try to make those offers and then the program start is on January 12th, 2026.
[22:23] program start is on January 12th, 2026. So that's a bit about each stage. Um, we
[22:26] So that's a bit about each stage. Um, we will jump into Q&amp;A here in just a couple
[22:28] will jump into Q&amp;A here in just a couple minutes, but I want to highlight there's
[22:30] minutes, but I want to highlight there's probably a lot of questions in the Q&amp;A
[22:32] probably a lot of questions in the Q&amp;A and maybe we won't get to all Q&amp;A today,
[22:34] and maybe we won't get to all Q&amp;A today, but I want to highlight on the notion
[22:35] but I want to highlight on the notion page, we also have a section of Q&amp;As's.
[22:38] page, we also have a section of Q&amp;As's. Um, and there's lots of things sort of
[22:39] Um, and there's lots of things sort of embedded in that in that list. So, be
[22:42] embedded in that in that list. So, be sure to check that out. Um, if your
[22:43] sure to check that out. Um, if your question doesn't get answered and it's
[22:45] question doesn't get answered and it's not listed in the FAQ, we also have a
[22:47] not listed in the FAQ, we also have a form um shown on the right there and the
[22:50] form um shown on the right there and the link to that form is in the notion page.
[22:52] link to that form is in the notion page. Um, and you can submit your question
[22:54] Um, and you can submit your question there. So, yeah, hopefully we'll get to
[22:56] there. So, yeah, hopefully we'll get to all the questions, but if we don't um
[22:58] all the questions, but if we don't um and then lastly, I want to highlight our
[23:00] and then lastly, I want to highlight our YouTube channel. So, we have sorry,
[23:02] YouTube channel. So, we have sorry, YouTube playlist. Um, on our YouTube
[23:04] YouTube playlist. Um, on our YouTube channel, we have a playlist that is
[23:06] channel, we have a playlist that is designed um just for scholars. So it
[23:09] designed um just for scholars. So it talks a bit about um you know what the
[23:12] talks a bit about um you know what the what the program is like growing as a
[23:14] what the program is like growing as a researcher, what it takes to become a
[23:16] researcher, what it takes to become a coherent labs research scholar. So um I
[23:18] coherent labs research scholar. So um I highly recommend checking out these
[23:19] highly recommend checking out these videos. Also the session recording for
[23:23] videos. Also the session recording for this session will be added to this
[23:24] this session will be added to this playlist. So if you're like I want to
[23:26] playlist. So if you're like I want to watch this again, I forgot everything.
[23:27] watch this again, I forgot everything. Come back to this playlist. And I think
[23:29] Come back to this playlist. And I think we're going to drop the playlist link in
[23:31] we're going to drop the playlist link in the chat. Um and so yeah, you'll find
[23:33] the chat. Um and so yeah, you'll find the recording here in in a couple days.
[23:36] the recording here in in a couple days. And then yeah, next I'm really excited
[23:38] And then yeah, next I'm really excited to pass it over to our scholars. So um
[23:42] to pass it over to our scholars. So um scholars, if you want to introduce
[23:43] scholars, if you want to introduce yourself and maybe a little bit about
[23:45] yourself and maybe a little bit about your research, that would be great. Um
[23:47] your research, that would be great. Um Amomar, can we can we can I pass it to
[23:49] Amomar, can we can we can I pass it to you first?
[23:51] you first? Yeah, of course. Thanks a lot for uh hi
[23:54] Yeah, of course. Thanks a lot for uh hi everyone. So great to see lots of you in
[23:57] everyone. So great to see lots of you in this information session. Uh it's really
[24:01] this information session. Uh it's really really exciting. So yeah, a little bit
[24:03] really exciting. So yeah, a little bit of introduction about myself. My name is
[24:05] of introduction about myself. My name is Omar Amari. Uh I'm based in London right
[24:08] Omar Amari. Uh I'm based in London right now and I'm a research scholar started
[24:11] now and I'm a research scholar started in January. So the uh most recent batch
[24:15] in January. So the uh most recent batch and yeah for the last month is I have
[24:18] and yeah for the last month is I have the pleasure of working with co here on
[24:21] the pleasure of working with co here on uh inference time scaling. So what I've
[24:24] uh inference time scaling. So what I've been working on is how we can improve
[24:27] been working on is how we can improve the performance of large language models
[24:29] the performance of large language models at test time without needing to do like
[24:31] at test time without needing to do like any training or uh gradient optimization
[24:34] any training or uh gradient optimization and we apply this to uh multilingual and
[24:38] and we apply this to uh multilingual and multitask uh situation and our work has
[24:43] multitask uh situation and our work has been published and we have this metaphor
[24:46] been published and we have this metaphor of the LLM lemonade where we squeeze out
[24:50] of the LLM lemonade where we squeeze out the most uh the most performance of the
[24:53] the most uh the most performance of the models using the methods that we
[24:54] models using the methods that we developed through the scholar program.
[24:56] developed through the scholar program. Uh so it was a very exciting time and a
[24:58] Uh so it was a very exciting time and a very nice project and exciting to hear
[25:01] very nice project and exciting to hear all your questions about it and answer
[25:02] all your questions about it and answer it and let you know and yeah that's
[25:05] it and let you know and yeah that's about it for me and I can pass it on to
[25:07] about it for me and I can pass it on to Diana.
[25:10] Diana. Hi everyone. Um I'm Diana. I'm also a
[25:13] Hi everyone. Um I'm Diana. I'm also a 2025 research scholar started in January
[25:16] 2025 research scholar started in January as well. Um and I'm based in New York
[25:19] as well. Um and I'm based in New York City. Um my project has been working on
[25:23] City. Um my project has been working on pre-training small geoclustered models
[25:27] pre-training small geoclustered models um so around like a 3B scale um and
[25:31] um so around like a 3B scale um and looking at regions of the world for
[25:33] looking at regions of the world for example like Europe um Middle East, Asia
[25:36] example like Europe um Middle East, Asia um to support the languages spoken in
[25:38] um to support the languages spoken in those regions. So it's been very
[25:40] those regions. So it's been very exciting. Um we also published a paper
[25:43] exciting. Um we also published a paper on um training tokenizers to support um
[25:48] on um training tokenizers to support um many many different languages in
[25:49] many many different languages in particular to enable um adaptation of
[25:52] particular to enable um adaptation of that of that model in post- training
[25:54] that of that model in post- training more easily and how you can kind of um
[25:58] more easily and how you can kind of um you can enable those capabilities even
[26:00] you can enable those capabilities even in the tokenization stage before you do
[26:02] in the tokenization stage before you do any training. Um so yeah uh also very
[26:06] any training. Um so yeah uh also very excited to share my experiences and
[26:09] excited to share my experiences and welcome a new batch.
[26:14] Great. Thanks so much Amar and Diana and Amar and Diana will stick around for the
[26:17] Amar and Diana will stick around for the Q&amp;A that we'll jump into here in just a
[26:19] Q&amp;A that we'll jump into here in just a moment. So um if there are questions
[26:22] moment. So um if there are questions that are specific to the scholars and
[26:25] that are specific to the scholars and maybe what the program is like or
[26:26] maybe what the program is like or something like that um feel free to ask
[26:28] something like that um feel free to ask those in the Q&amp;A and and we can we can
[26:30] those in the Q&amp;A and and we can we can put Amomar and Diana on the spot here.
[26:33] put Amomar and Diana on the spot here. Um, so yeah, I think with that we'll
[26:34] Um, so yeah, I think with that we'll jump into the Q&amp;A section of this call.
[26:38] jump into the Q&amp;A section of this call. Um, so it looks like people have been
[26:41] Um, so it looks like people have been using the Q&amp;A, which is awesome. So we
[26:43] using the Q&amp;A, which is awesome. So we will take a look there. Marzy, if it's
[26:45] will take a look there. Marzy, if it's easier if you want to stop sharing
[26:47] easier if you want to stop sharing screen, I think you can. For me, it's
[26:49] screen, I think you can. For me, it's tricky to see Q&amp;A and screen. So you're
[26:51] tricky to see Q&amp;A and screen. So you're welcome to stop sharing. Um, so yeah,
[26:54] welcome to stop sharing. Um, so yeah, let's take a look at the Q&amp;A here.
[26:57] let's take a look at the Q&amp;A here. There's a lot of questions that are
[26:59] There's a lot of questions that are talking about PhD students and can I
[27:03] talking about PhD students and can I apply if I'm at with as a PhD student.
[27:05] apply if I'm at with as a PhD student. So, I'll quickly address that sort of as
[27:08] So, I'll quickly address that sort of as a whole. Unfortunately, not. This is a
[27:10] a whole. Unfortunately, not. This is a full-time um opportunity and we we don't
[27:13] full-time um opportunity and we we don't allow people to be working as a PhD
[27:15] allow people to be working as a PhD student at the same time. Um the reason
[27:17] student at the same time. Um the reason being we really want you to focus on,
[27:19] being we really want you to focus on, you know, the opportunity to work at
[27:21] you know, the opportunity to work at Coher Labs and it is a full-time um
[27:25] Coher Labs and it is a full-time um role. So it you would be stretched too
[27:27] role. So it you would be stretched too thin, I think. So um yeah, we just
[27:29] thin, I think. So um yeah, we just really want you to focus in on the
[27:31] really want you to focus in on the program. Um Marzy, is there any other is
[27:33] program. Um Marzy, is there any other is there some questions that you'd like to
[27:36] there some questions that you'd like to Yeah, thanks. Uh there's actually a fun
[27:38] Yeah, thanks. Uh there's actually a fun question for Diana or Amar, either of
[27:41] question for Diana or Amar, either of you. What does a typical day or week of
[27:43] you. What does a typical day or week of a scholar look like?
[27:47] Who wants to go? Um I can go first. I guess it will
[27:50] Um I can go first. I guess it will probably be different between me and
[27:52] probably be different between me and Amar, but um kind of generally like at
[27:55] Amar, but um kind of generally like at the beginning of the program, most of
[27:57] the beginning of the program, most of your days are spent reading um doing
[28:00] your days are spent reading um doing literature review, building up your
[28:02] literature review, building up your background knowledge in the area, um
[28:04] background knowledge in the area, um maybe suggesting some ideas, talking to
[28:06] maybe suggesting some ideas, talking to your mentors about it. Um and then
[28:10] your mentors about it. Um and then you're getting onboarded to um the
[28:12] you're getting onboarded to um the existing infrastructure and libraries at
[28:14] existing infrastructure and libraries at Coher. Thankfully we get to um leverage
[28:17] Coher. Thankfully we get to um leverage those in running our experiments and
[28:19] those in running our experiments and stuff like that. So that can be a little
[28:21] stuff like that. So that can be a little difficult that can take some time. Um
[28:23] difficult that can take some time. Um but once you get past that hurdle it
[28:25] but once you get past that hurdle it enables um a lot of quick
[28:27] enables um a lot of quick experimentation. Um and then for me um
[28:30] experimentation. Um and then for me um the days past that point are a lot of
[28:32] the days past that point are a lot of like um coming up with experiments,
[28:35] like um coming up with experiments, experiment monitoring, um interpreting
[28:38] experiment monitoring, um interpreting results um and determining like how to
[28:41] results um and determining like how to move forward from there. um digging
[28:44] move forward from there. um digging around for bugs, um writing one-off
[28:47] around for bugs, um writing one-off scripts here and there. So, uh the days
[28:50] scripts here and there. So, uh the days look very different in in different
[28:51] look very different in in different phases of the program. Um beyond that,
[28:54] phases of the program. Um beyond that, there's also like the paperwriting stage
[28:56] there's also like the paperwriting stage and that's mostly like you're staring at
[28:58] and that's mostly like you're staring at your Overleaf document. Um you're
[29:01] your Overleaf document. Um you're tinkering around with plots in Mattplot
[29:04] tinkering around with plots in Mattplot Live. Um making sure that things look
[29:06] Live. Um making sure that things look good. Um, so the days are extremely
[29:09] good. Um, so the days are extremely varied, but I think that's actually
[29:11] varied, but I think that's actually great because it doesn't it's not
[29:12] great because it doesn't it's not monotonous. Um, and you find the time
[29:15] monotonous. Um, and you find the time throughout to um, of course like keep
[29:17] throughout to um, of course like keep reading and and keep asking questions.
[29:24] Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. Uh yeah, I just wanted to add like
[29:29] Yeah. Uh yeah, I just wanted to add like to what the Anna said like it's a great
[29:31] to what the Anna said like it's a great answer and yeah, I think the main point
[29:34] answer and yeah, I think the main point is that every day or every week is
[29:36] is that every day or every week is different when you're at the scholar
[29:37] different when you're at the scholar program and yeah uh one of the things
[29:42] program and yeah uh one of the things that you also do that as you are running
[29:44] that you also do that as you are running experiments and as you are coming with
[29:46] experiments and as you are coming with results uh you get to talk with your
[29:49] results uh you get to talk with your mentors mostly on a weekly basis and you
[29:52] mentors mostly on a weekly basis and you have like the
[29:55] have like the uh the freedom to see what the results
[29:58] uh the freedom to see what the results are are how you interpret them and you
[30:00] are are how you interpret them and you can discuss with your mentors how you
[30:02] can discuss with your mentors how you can which direction you want to go into
[30:04] can which direction you want to go into your research. So that's also like an
[30:06] your research. So that's also like an interesting part that I want to
[30:07] interesting part that I want to highlight of my day like these
[30:08] highlight of my day like these discussions like every week are some
[30:10] discussions like every week are some nice parts of the program.
[30:13] nice parts of the program. Yeah, that's uh that's very nice and
[30:15] Yeah, that's uh that's very nice and maybe I can connect it to another
[30:16] maybe I can connect it to another question which is about what is the
[30:18] question which is about what is the structure of the research scholar
[30:21] structure of the research scholar program for instance weekly agenda
[30:23] program for instance weekly agenda milestones and um I would say that it's
[30:28] milestones and um I would say that it's again like similar to what uh Diana
[30:31] again like similar to what uh Diana mentioned it changes throughout the the
[30:33] mentioned it changes throughout the the project depending on the phase of the
[30:35] project depending on the phase of the project but there are some uh constants
[30:38] project but there are some uh constants there so for instance we uh for each
[30:41] there so for instance we uh for each project there is a weekly project
[30:43] project there is a weekly project meeting where uh every mentor of the
[30:45] meeting where uh every mentor of the project and the scholar they meet they
[30:47] project and the scholar they meet they talk about the progress and the next
[30:50] talk about the progress and the next steps. Usually uh the the scholar and
[30:53] steps. Usually uh the the scholar and the main mentor uh they have weekly
[30:56] the main mentor uh they have weekly one-on- ones and that's also uh that's
[30:58] one-on- ones and that's also uh that's one of the things that might change
[31:00] one of the things that might change throughout the phase of the project. So
[31:02] throughout the phase of the project. So maybe it would start once a week as it
[31:04] maybe it would start once a week as it gets closer to maybe looking at the
[31:06] gets closer to maybe looking at the code, analyzing the results um or
[31:10] code, analyzing the results um or actually debugging or the the paper even
[31:13] actually debugging or the the paper even paper writing stage you might meet every
[31:15] paper writing stage you might meet every day. Um and uh the the main milestones
[31:20] day. Um and uh the the main milestones that we have is to publish the work in
[31:23] that we have is to publish the work in the end. So depending on when the paper
[31:25] the end. So depending on when the paper is ready and the the conference
[31:27] is ready and the the conference deadlines uh that is something that we
[31:29] deadlines uh that is something that we usually plan uh publications and
[31:32] usually plan uh publications and releases of models data resources
[31:36] releases of models data resources and then we also have an internal like I
[31:39] and then we also have an internal like I mentioned if we uh usually in the middle
[31:42] mentioned if we uh usually in the middle of the program we all meet in person and
[31:45] of the program we all meet in person and that is kind of like an internal
[31:47] that is kind of like an internal deadline as well to report the uh the
[31:49] deadline as well to report the uh the work that is in progress. So that's
[31:51] work that is in progress. So that's another milestone there.
[31:56] Uh any other questions you find? And I also see some raising hands. Maybe we
[32:00] also see some raising hands. Maybe we can also
[32:02] can also uh yeah, if anyone wants to unmute and
[32:06] uh yeah, if anyone wants to unmute and ask questions, you can do that.
[32:11] Okay. until we get to that. I see this interesting question from Yasm mean here
[32:17] interesting question from Yasm mean here uh asking about like uh from a
[32:21] uh asking about like uh from a background in telecommunications
[32:23] background in telecommunications would it be reasonable to apply to the
[32:25] would it be reasonable to apply to the scholar program and I would say 100% it
[32:27] scholar program and I would say 100% it is uh the scholar program is mostly
[32:30] is uh the scholar program is mostly designed to as an entry point to
[32:33] designed to as an entry point to traditional and uh early career stages
[32:36] traditional and uh early career stages into AI research. So if you feel like
[32:40] into AI research. So if you feel like you have the interest and you want to do
[32:43] you have the interest and you want to do research at the top lab and you have the
[32:47] research at the top lab and you have the skills and the curiosity so please do
[32:49] skills and the curiosity so please do apply and even you come from a a
[32:54] apply and even you come from a a background that's slightly different
[32:55] background that's slightly different from language models for NLB that's also
[32:58] from language models for NLB that's also okay uh and especially if you feel like
[33:01] okay uh and especially if you feel like you have the strong engineering uh
[33:03] you have the strong engineering uh skills background.
[33:05] skills background. Yeah.
[33:07] Yeah. Thanks, Samar. I see another one here
[33:09] Thanks, Samar. I see another one here for Diana and Amar specifically. It
[33:11] for Diana and Amar specifically. It talks about speaking on the involvement
[33:12] talks about speaking on the involvement of mentorship um and the available of
[33:15] of mentorship um and the available of compute to run self-directed
[33:17] compute to run self-directed experiments. Do you want to talk about a
[33:19] experiments. Do you want to talk about a little bit about that? I think
[33:20] little bit about that? I think specifically the mentorship is something
[33:22] specifically the mentorship is something that that is that would be nice to hear
[33:24] that that is that would be nice to hear about.
[33:26] about. Um I can go first. I guess mentorship is
[33:29] Um I can go first. I guess mentorship is truly phenomenal. Um that was a huge
[33:32] truly phenomenal. Um that was a huge draw for me to this program because um
[33:35] draw for me to this program because um you know it can be hard to come by in
[33:36] you know it can be hard to come by in other places and this is specifically
[33:38] other places and this is specifically like eight months of uh these um
[33:42] like eight months of uh these um incredible accomplished researchers who
[33:44] incredible accomplished researchers who are like very available um to speak with
[33:46] are like very available um to speak with you and uh you know you get to explore
[33:50] you and uh you know you get to explore these really interesting questions
[33:52] these really interesting questions together with them and like um ask them
[33:55] together with them and like um ask them questions and see also like what is
[33:56] questions and see also like what is their research um instinct um what kinds
[34:00] their research um instinct um what kinds of questions do do they ask and how
[34:02] of questions do do they ask and how would they investigate them? That has
[34:04] would they investigate them? That has been like very interesting for me to
[34:06] been like very interesting for me to pick up on and to kind of develop my
[34:08] pick up on and to kind of develop my intuition as a researcher. Um and then
[34:11] intuition as a researcher. Um and then also like career stuff um or general
[34:14] also like career stuff um or general personal stuff like people are very
[34:15] personal stuff like people are very available to just talk with you about
[34:18] available to just talk with you about them and I've really appreciated that as
[34:20] them and I've really appreciated that as well. um beyond your direct mentor or
[34:23] well. um beyond your direct mentor or people who are on the project like
[34:24] people who are on the project like everyone in the lab is just um very open
[34:27] everyone in the lab is just um very open and available um to that sort of thing
[34:29] and available um to that sort of thing and they're invested in seeing your um
[34:32] and they're invested in seeing your um continued success and growth in your
[34:34] continued success and growth in your career. So that's been really great. Um
[34:37] career. So that's been really great. Um quickly on the compute question, lots of
[34:40] quickly on the compute question, lots of compute available thankfully. I mean
[34:42] compute available thankfully. I mean there's there's definitely restrictions
[34:44] there's there's definitely restrictions and you want to use it wisely but um
[34:47] and you want to use it wisely but um another huge appeal of the program is
[34:49] another huge appeal of the program is that a lot of us um come from places
[34:52] that a lot of us um come from places where uh that's really hard to come by
[34:54] where uh that's really hard to come by um even in universities um compute is
[34:57] um even in universities um compute is restricted and you definitely have
[35:00] restricted and you definitely have access to like more of it here that that
[35:02] access to like more of it here that that opens up the door to more
[35:04] opens up the door to more experimentation.
[35:07] Yeah, there's a question here I want to quickly say. So uh Muhammad asked do you
[35:12] quickly say. So uh Muhammad asked do you choose what area of research you will
[35:14] choose what area of research you will work on if selected and uh we uh the the
[35:18] work on if selected and uh we uh the the the main mentors and uh uh the the group
[35:21] the main mentors and uh uh the the group of people who will work on the project
[35:24] of people who will work on the project they will come up with the ideas. So
[35:25] they will come up with the ideas. So there are uh that is how we we set the
[35:29] there are uh that is how we we set the research agenda of our lab. So uh in the
[35:33] research agenda of our lab. So uh in the final round of uh the interview process,
[35:36] final round of uh the interview process, there's also this aspect of matching
[35:39] there's also this aspect of matching candidates, potential candidates to
[35:41] candidates, potential candidates to projects that we have defined for next
[35:43] projects that we have defined for next year. Uh you will still have uh of
[35:47] year. Uh you will still have uh of course uh autonomy to come up with uh
[35:50] course uh autonomy to come up with uh maybe new solutions or or different ways
[35:53] maybe new solutions or or different ways to explore that problem. But the main uh
[35:55] to explore that problem. But the main uh the the main research question that you
[35:57] the the main research question that you want to uh that you will be working on
[36:00] want to uh that you will be working on uh will be defined before you join the
[36:02] uh will be defined before you join the program.
[36:04] program. I can also add to this um whatever you
[36:07] I can also add to this um whatever you end up working on it's very much
[36:09] end up working on it's very much determined by your interests. Um and so
[36:12] determined by your interests. Um and so the the lab like they put in a lot of
[36:15] the the lab like they put in a lot of effort to pair um scholars with projects
[36:18] effort to pair um scholars with projects that they would be really interested in
[36:19] that they would be really interested in running um sorry in working on. Um so uh
[36:24] running um sorry in working on. Um so uh while the projects are like
[36:25] while the projects are like predetermined um that pairing um is very
[36:28] predetermined um that pairing um is very much open and you want to show uh the
[36:31] much open and you want to show uh the areas that you're the most interested
[36:32] areas that you're the most interested in.
[36:37] I like another question maybe I can uh and Britannia feel free to if you also
[36:42] and Britannia feel free to if you also find some questions uh let us know but
[36:44] find some questions uh let us know but uh there is a question from Sami uh and
[36:47] uh there is a question from Sami uh and they ask what are the specific skills
[36:49] they ask what are the specific skills that you value the most in a scholar and
[36:52] that you value the most in a scholar and I think it's a good open-ended question
[36:55] I think it's a good open-ended question that uh maybe I can share uh from my
[36:59] that uh maybe I can share uh from my perspective and my experience and also
[37:01] perspective and my experience and also then Diana and Emar maybe you can share
[37:04] then Diana and Emar maybe you can share what in your mind like makes a
[37:06] what in your mind like makes a successful scholar. Um so
[37:10] successful scholar. Um so the design of this program is in a way
[37:13] the design of this program is in a way that we look for
[37:15] that we look for uh people that are more junior. So like
[37:18] uh people that are more junior. So like uh if you uh especially emerging talent
[37:22] uh if you uh especially emerging talent who wants to get involved in research
[37:24] who wants to get involved in research that means that it's going to be it's
[37:26] that means that it's going to be it's not going to be easy like if you haven't
[37:29] not going to be easy like if you haven't really worked on a research project in
[37:31] really worked on a research project in that scale. Uh there's definitely going
[37:33] that scale. Uh there's definitely going to be challenges to to learn and to
[37:37] to be challenges to to learn and to adapt. But what skill is really
[37:40] adapt. But what skill is really important to have to be successful is uh
[37:44] important to have to be successful is uh resilience and really really persistency
[37:48] resilience and really really persistency in in your work and trusting the
[37:51] in in your work and trusting the process. So research is going to be uh a
[37:55] process. So research is going to be uh a lot of downs before there is an up like
[37:57] lot of downs before there is an up like you uh almost never the first experiment
[38:00] you uh almost never the first experiment will work and the first solution will
[38:02] will work and the first solution will work. So really uh having this attitude
[38:05] work. So really uh having this attitude of not getting disappointed uh
[38:08] of not getting disappointed uh continuing to push uh to find that
[38:10] continuing to push uh to find that little gem in all of the work that you
[38:12] little gem in all of the work that you are doing. I think that makes a big
[38:16] are doing. I think that makes a big difference uh between a successful
[38:18] difference uh between a successful scholar u and uh someone who might not
[38:22] scholar u and uh someone who might not succeed. Of course this means also a
[38:26] succeed. Of course this means also a really excellent level of machine
[38:28] really excellent level of machine learning engineering uh background and
[38:31] learning engineering uh background and skill set. So you you do want to be able
[38:33] skill set. So you you do want to be able to iterate quite fast on different
[38:36] to iterate quite fast on different experiments and um
[38:39] experiments and um uh be uh skillful in figuring out
[38:44] uh be uh skillful in figuring out problems and issues and things like
[38:46] problems and issues and things like that. So there's also like that aspect
[38:49] that. So there's also like that aspect that I think by like each of them by
[38:51] that I think by like each of them by themselves are not really uh uh enough
[38:54] themselves are not really uh uh enough in my mind but putting them together
[38:57] in my mind but putting them together someone with a strong engineering
[38:58] someone with a strong engineering background that is really prepared to
[39:01] background that is really prepared to dig deep and go through the process of
[39:03] dig deep and go through the process of failure to get to the success. Uh that
[39:07] failure to get to the success. Uh that in my mind is a really nice combination.
[39:11] in my mind is a really nice combination. Uh what do you think guys?
[39:19] [Music] Yeah,
[39:21] Yeah, I think this is a very good answer in
[39:24] I think this is a very good answer in general. I was looking at some other
[39:27] general. I was looking at some other questions that I also think is uh kind
[39:30] questions that I also think is uh kind of uh related to this aspect. Uh asking
[39:33] of uh related to this aspect. Uh asking about the uh me and Diana about our
[39:37] about the uh me and Diana about our background and what we did before this.
[39:40] background and what we did before this. uh and I want to take this question as a
[39:42] uh and I want to take this question as a chance to maybe talk about my background
[39:44] chance to maybe talk about my background and also like how you can use that in
[39:46] and also like how you can use that in the application process. So before this
[39:49] the application process. So before this I was I did my bachelors in electrical
[39:52] I was I did my bachelors in electrical engineering and then I did the masters
[39:55] engineering and then I did the masters in uh AI. So, but what I want to
[39:59] in uh AI. So, but what I want to highlight here is that when doing the
[40:03] highlight here is that when doing the application and you find like you have
[40:05] application and you find like you have to do the personal statement and the
[40:07] to do the personal statement and the video, you don't need to be intimidated
[40:11] video, you don't need to be intimidated by
[40:12] by quote unquote the lack of of experience
[40:14] quote unquote the lack of of experience or research experience you have here. Uh
[40:17] or research experience you have here. Uh so you try try to think of what you have
[40:20] so you try try to think of what you have done and why you are interested in this
[40:22] done and why you are interested in this program and what you want to do and
[40:25] program and what you want to do and really use the personal statement and
[40:27] really use the personal statement and the video as a chance to showcase how
[40:31] the video as a chance to showcase how your background could be helpful for you
[40:33] your background could be helpful for you and to to succeed in the program. So uh
[40:37] and to to succeed in the program. So uh I would say uh because of the nature of
[40:40] I would say uh because of the nature of the program because of the entry and for
[40:42] the program because of the entry and for like new to the research. So we expect
[40:44] like new to the research. So we expect like most of you prank will have uh
[40:47] like most of you prank will have uh strong uh research background. So yeah
[40:51] strong uh research background. So yeah so really make use of the 500 words you
[40:53] so really make use of the 500 words you have on the personal statement and the
[40:54] have on the personal statement and the video to show like your research skills
[40:57] video to show like your research skills and interest in the open science
[40:59] and interest in the open science questions.
[41:05] Oh yeah if anyone have any other question.
[41:08] question. No that was really nice. Uh maybe I can
[41:10] No that was really nice. Uh maybe I can do like a few quick rounds of uh I see a
[41:13] do like a few quick rounds of uh I see a question about whether we uh accept
[41:16] question about whether we uh accept applications from India. Yes, definitely
[41:18] applications from India. Yes, definitely from anywhere in the world and we
[41:20] from anywhere in the world and we already actually have people on our team
[41:22] already actually have people on our team uh working from India as well. Uh
[41:25] uh working from India as well. Uh there's another question their
[41:26] there's another question their background is in robotics and
[41:28] background is in robotics and manufacturing uh and different than LLM
[41:32] manufacturing uh and different than LLM in general. Are we eligible to apply? So
[41:35] in general. Are we eligible to apply? So eligibility is less about your
[41:37] eligibility is less about your background and more about your skill and
[41:39] background and more about your skill and your interest to work on these projects.
[41:41] your interest to work on these projects. So definitely uh if you are interested
[41:45] So definitely uh if you are interested in working on research in uh
[41:51] in working on research in uh language models um whether it's like NLP
[41:54] language models um whether it's like NLP multimodality then uh yeah you would be
[41:58] multimodality then uh yeah you would be a great candidate. Uh there's a question
[42:01] a great candidate. Uh there's a question about whether they I think there was a
[42:03] about whether they I think there was a question about they're defending in
[42:05] question about they're defending in January and whether they can join or
[42:08] January and whether they can join or not. Um so unfortunately this is a
[42:11] not. Um so unfortunately this is a full-time program. So we want the uh the
[42:14] full-time program. So we want the uh the applicants to be available for the
[42:16] applicants to be available for the duration of the program. So if you have
[42:18] duration of the program. So if you have commitments to your school or your uh
[42:21] commitments to your school or your uh your jobs even for a short period of
[42:23] your jobs even for a short period of time uh that overlaps with the time of
[42:26] time uh that overlaps with the time of the program uh you wouldn't be eligible
[42:30] the program uh you wouldn't be eligible uh for uh yeah for this
[42:34] uh for uh yeah for this um any other quick questions I can
[42:37] um any other quick questions I can answer.
[42:39] answer. There's a nice one here Marzy. It's not
[42:41] There's a nice one here Marzy. It's not I don't think it's an a quick one but
[42:43] I don't think it's an a quick one but someone Elena asked hi Diana and Amomar.
[42:46] someone Elena asked hi Diana and Amomar. Would you both be willing to share any
[42:47] Would you both be willing to share any specific tips from your applications
[42:49] specific tips from your applications that helped you stand out if you're
[42:51] that helped you stand out if you're comfortable sharing? So, any tips on
[42:53] comfortable sharing? So, any tips on standing out, Amomar or Diana?
[42:57] standing out, Amomar or Diana? I would also suggest Diana to share your
[42:59] I would also suggest Diana to share your how you recorded your video for everyone
[43:02] how you recorded your video for everyone if you like.
[43:03] if you like. I was going to answer um someone else
[43:05] I was going to answer um someone else asked uh Oma asked about the video in
[43:07] asked uh Oma asked about the video in particular and how to prepare for it if
[43:09] particular and how to prepare for it if there are any tips. Um so the video
[43:12] there are any tips. Um so the video prompt was similar last year also like
[43:15] prompt was similar last year also like you know um uh select a paper and uh
[43:18] you know um uh select a paper and uh suggest how you would um extend it or
[43:21] suggest how you would um extend it or like another potential um direction. Um
[43:24] like another potential um direction. Um and so I had read through a bunch of the
[43:25] and so I had read through a bunch of the papers even before like applying to the
[43:27] papers even before like applying to the program I had. Um and I had a few
[43:30] program I had. Um and I had a few different ones selected that I had
[43:32] different ones selected that I had potential answers for. Um, but I think I
[43:36] potential answers for. Um, but I think I like spent too long like,
[43:38] like spent too long like, you know, like what's the perfect one
[43:40] you know, like what's the perfect one for me to choose and whatever. Um, and
[43:43] for me to choose and whatever. Um, and it got to the point where I was
[43:45] it got to the point where I was traveling and I didn't have time to like
[43:47] traveling and I didn't have time to like have the perfect setup to record the
[43:49] have the perfect setup to record the video. Um, so I was in my best friend's
[43:52] video. Um, so I was in my best friend's car and it was like really close to um
[43:54] car and it was like really close to um the deadline and I told her about this
[43:56] the deadline and I told her about this and she was like, "Just record it now."
[43:57] and she was like, "Just record it now." Um, cuz we weren't going to finish
[43:59] Um, cuz we weren't going to finish driving before the deadline. Um, so we
[44:03] driving before the deadline. Um, so we pulled into a parking lot uh of a drive
[44:05] pulled into a parking lot uh of a drive uh of a gas station actually and I put
[44:07] uh of a gas station actually and I put on my big headphones with with a nice
[44:10] on my big headphones with with a nice microphone and I recorded it directly in
[44:11] microphone and I recorded it directly in the car. Um, so the main thing there uh
[44:15] the car. Um, so the main thing there uh that I can advise is like um definitely
[44:19] that I can advise is like um definitely like uh you know spend a lot of time um
[44:22] like uh you know spend a lot of time um carefully considering the papers and
[44:23] carefully considering the papers and like what your um suggestions are for
[44:26] like what your um suggestions are for for potential avenues. But um that's
[44:28] for potential avenues. But um that's much more important than like the exact
[44:31] much more important than like the exact setup in which you record your video. Um
[44:34] setup in which you record your video. Um do your best to make sure that um your
[44:37] do your best to make sure that um your audio can be heard well. I think that's
[44:39] audio can be heard well. I think that's definitely really important. Um and do
[44:42] definitely really important. Um and do your best with your background, but
[44:44] your best with your background, but things happen like we're all in
[44:45] things happen like we're all in different situations and stuff. So, um
[44:48] different situations and stuff. So, um definitely let your passion shine
[44:50] definitely let your passion shine through and that's going to be the most
[44:51] through and that's going to be the most important thing.
[44:56] I love that story and I know like the so the uh the people who reviewed Diana's
[45:01] the uh the people who reviewed Diana's video they were like it looks like the
[45:03] video they were like it looks like the background looks like it's it weird like
[45:06] background looks like it's it weird like it's dark it's but yeah we confirmed
[45:09] it's dark it's but yeah we confirmed with her and it was in a car.
[45:15] Uh there's a question. Oh Amar, go ahead. Sorry you were actually Yeah. No,
[45:19] ahead. Sorry you were actually Yeah. No, a lot of Yeah, go ahead.
[45:21] a lot of Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, lots of interesting questions.
[45:23] Yeah, lots of interesting questions. Yeah, there is this questions here
[45:25] Yeah, there is this questions here asking about three different questions.
[45:27] asking about three different questions. The first one is uh how this how has
[45:30] The first one is uh how this how has this program changed your views and
[45:31] this program changed your views and research? Uh what's the experience you
[45:34] research? Uh what's the experience you had? I think we talked about this a
[45:35] had? I think we talked about this a little bit and what advice do you have
[45:36] little bit and what advice do you have for newcomers? So for the first part of
[45:40] for newcomers? So for the first part of the question, what how this uh program
[45:42] the question, what how this uh program changed your views and research? I think
[45:45] changed your views and research? I think it's hard to overestimate how this
[45:47] it's hard to overestimate how this program have changed my views and my uh
[45:51] program have changed my views and my uh like trust in my skills and reliability
[45:53] like trust in my skills and reliability in doing research. Uh because as it has
[45:57] in doing research. Uh because as it has been said quite sometimes now it's a
[45:58] been said quite sometimes now it's a very intense program uh with a goal of
[46:02] very intense program uh with a goal of like after uh uh six or seven months you
[46:05] like after uh uh six or seven months you will be writing a paper to be uh
[46:08] will be writing a paper to be uh submitted to one of the top conference
[46:10] submitted to one of the top conference in AI. uh and throughout this process
[46:13] in AI. uh and throughout this process you do research rig uh rigorously and
[46:16] you do research rig uh rigorously and you do have lots of re lots of compute
[46:19] you do have lots of re lots of compute and lots of great uh mentors. So it's
[46:23] and lots of great uh mentors. So it's as good as it can gets in terms of
[46:26] as good as it can gets in terms of research for new entry uh uh researchers
[46:29] research for new entry uh uh researchers and newcomers. So I think this program
[46:33] and newcomers. So I think this program is really like uh fundamental
[46:37] is really like uh fundamental fundamental in the way that I am as a
[46:40] fundamental in the way that I am as a researcher now. And yeah, if I have any
[46:43] researcher now. And yeah, if I have any advice for newcomers again uh just try
[46:47] advice for newcomers again uh just try when you
[46:49] when you communicate your research interest and
[46:51] communicate your research interest and what you want to do in your uh scores in
[46:54] what you want to do in your uh scores in your personal statement for the scores
[46:56] your personal statement for the scores program. Just try to uh dig deep and
[47:00] program. Just try to uh dig deep and think about it a lot and write it very
[47:01] think about it a lot and write it very clearly and be very explicit about what
[47:03] clearly and be very explicit about what you like and what you want to do because
[47:05] you like and what you want to do because this will get you like uh make it a
[47:08] this will get you like uh make it a standout personal statement and also it
[47:09] standout personal statement and also it will be helpful in how you get matched
[47:11] will be helpful in how you get matched with different mentors as the program uh
[47:13] with different mentors as the program uh begins and how you go through your
[47:16] begins and how you go through your research. Yeah.
[47:22] Thanks. I think another quick one, Marzia, there's lots of people asking
[47:26] Marzia, there's lots of people asking how many scholars. Um, we typically
[47:28] how many scholars. Um, we typically accept anywhere from 5 to 10 scholars
[47:30] accept anywhere from 5 to 10 scholars per cohort each year. That's what we've
[47:32] per cohort each year. That's what we've done the last three years. Um, and this
[47:35] done the last three years. Um, and this cohort will be somewhere within that
[47:37] cohort will be somewhere within that same range. So, I just wanted to address
[47:38] same range. So, I just wanted to address that one really quickly because I know
[47:40] that one really quickly because I know lots of people are curious about that in
[47:41] lots of people are curious about that in the Q&amp;A.
[47:52] I think someone else also asked about will rejected applications get feedback.
[47:56] will rejected applications get feedback. Unfortunately, due to the volume of
[47:58] Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications, no, we will not be able to
[48:00] applications, no, we will not be able to provide feedback.
[48:02] provide feedback. Um, I'm just trying to go through any
[48:04] Um, I'm just trying to go through any other quick ones. Marzia or Amomar or
[48:06] other quick ones. Marzia or Amomar or Diana, if you see any other quick ones
[48:08] Diana, if you see any other quick ones or we can jump to a more in-depth one.
[48:10] or we can jump to a more in-depth one. Oh, okay. I see one here asking about
[48:14] Oh, okay. I see one here asking about the journals that we'll be submitting.
[48:16] the journals that we'll be submitting. Again, it will be depending on your
[48:18] Again, it will be depending on your research and at the time that you're
[48:20] research and at the time that you're submitting, but it's definitely one of
[48:23] submitting, but it's definitely one of the top conference in machine learning
[48:25] the top conference in machine learning that what will always be targeted.
[48:30] Uh yeah, I mean the the number of
[48:34] yeah, I mean the the number of applications is just from the people on
[48:37] applications is just from the people on this call, you can just guess like
[48:39] this call, you can just guess like there's a it's a very uh uh and for good
[48:42] there's a it's a very uh uh and for good reason because this is the fourth year
[48:45] reason because this is the fourth year and we really uh have shown how
[48:49] and we really uh have shown how impactful this program and the
[48:51] impactful this program and the researchers that we discover in this
[48:53] researchers that we discover in this program can be. Uh so we we we see how
[48:57] program can be. Uh so we we we see how many applications we get this year. Um
[49:00] many applications we get this year. Um uh but yeah it is very competitive and
[49:03] uh but yeah it is very competitive and uh we have a very high bar to select the
[49:05] uh we have a very high bar to select the final candidates.
[49:17] Uh there's a question about whether the forms and videos are evaluated manually
[49:22] forms and videos are evaluated manually or AI based evaluation. Everything is
[49:25] or AI based evaluation. Everything is done manually by multiple people. People
[49:29] done manually by multiple people. People on this call, people behind the scenes.
[49:32] on this call, people behind the scenes. I don't think we trust our AI systems
[49:36] I don't think we trust our AI systems this far. I think we still really want
[49:38] this far. I think we still really want to Yeah, there's some things that you
[49:41] to Yeah, there's some things that you don't really you cannot really do
[49:43] don't really you cannot really do automatically. So uh even checking the
[49:47] automatically. So uh even checking the uh the CVs uh the individual questions
[49:49] uh the CVs uh the individual questions the individual videos statements
[49:52] the individual videos statements everything we go through every
[49:53] everything we go through every application
[49:55] application um ourselves.
[50:03] Yeah I I've seen a few questions about visa sponsorship. So unfortunately we
[50:08] visa sponsorship. So unfortunately we don't provide any sponsorship. So um
[50:12] don't provide any sponsorship. So um ideally you have to be able to uh this
[50:15] ideally you have to be able to uh this is remote first so where you are living
[50:18] is remote first so where you are living uh you can join the program uh from
[50:21] uh you can join the program uh from there um but you have to be able to
[50:24] there um but you have to be able to leave where where you are so uh we we
[50:27] leave where where you are so uh we we wouldn't be able to provide any
[50:29] wouldn't be able to provide any sponsorship.
[50:36] Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead.
[50:39] Sorry. Go ahead. Yeah. I've also seen one question I
[50:41] Yeah. I've also seen one question I can't find it again but was about the
[50:43] can't find it again but was about the video and if someone can submit a demo
[50:46] video and if someone can submit a demo to the video uh I would say uh there is
[50:50] to the video uh I would say uh there is a prompt associated with the videos that
[50:51] a prompt associated with the videos that to talk about the specific paper and
[50:53] to talk about the specific paper and like to discuss way to extend it uh so
[50:56] like to discuss way to extend it uh so you can have freedom in how you want to
[50:58] you can have freedom in how you want to talk about that if you want to have some
[50:59] talk about that if you want to have some slides if you want to just talk about it
[51:01] slides if you want to just talk about it to a camera in a card like did but I
[51:03] to a camera in a card like did but I would say like mostly try to stick to
[51:05] would say like mostly try to stick to what the prompt is defined as to like if
[51:08] what the prompt is defined as to like if you want to show other work that you
[51:09] you want to show other work that you have done you can a personal statement
[51:10] have done you can a personal statement could be a better place for that for
[51:12] could be a better place for that for your CV. Okay.
[51:15] your CV. Okay. Yeah. There's a question about the what
[51:18] Yeah. There's a question about the what you would end up working on. Will it be
[51:21] you would end up working on. Will it be similar to those you mentioned in your
[51:23] similar to those you mentioned in your personal statement or previous
[51:24] personal statement or previous portfolio? Uh it depends on your
[51:28] portfolio? Uh it depends on your personal statement and portfolio. But uh
[51:30] personal statement and portfolio. But uh no that's not the uh uh uh the the goal.
[51:35] no that's not the uh uh uh the the goal. So we we have research ideas and
[51:38] So we we have research ideas and research questions in mind. We are
[51:40] research questions in mind. We are designing proposals for each scholar and
[51:44] designing proposals for each scholar and uh they will join the project knowing
[51:47] uh they will join the project knowing the the overall goal of the project. How
[51:49] the the overall goal of the project. How to achieve that? There's something that
[51:51] to achieve that? There's something that is a very collaborative process uh that
[51:54] is a very collaborative process uh that uh the scholar will do with the the
[51:57] uh the scholar will do with the the mentors on the project and if they have
[51:59] mentors on the project and if they have worked before on uh something similar
[52:02] worked before on uh something similar then yeah that's a nice coincidence but
[52:05] then yeah that's a nice coincidence but it definitely doesn't have to be and
[52:07] it definitely doesn't have to be and it's not going to be uh related to your
[52:10] it's not going to be uh related to your previous portfolio.
[52:22] There's a lot of questions or a couple questions here about sort of what
[52:25] questions here about sort of what happens after the scholar program which
[52:27] happens after the scholar program which is funny because we haven't started the
[52:28] is funny because we haven't started the scholar program yet but people are like
[52:30] scholar program yet but people are like what happens at the end um and I know we
[52:32] what happens at the end um and I know we briefly talked about it um you know on a
[52:34] briefly talked about it um you know on a slide here I think it's really your
[52:36] slide here I think it's really your journey right some people do this
[52:38] journey right some people do this program and say I want to go on to do a
[52:40] program and say I want to go on to do a PhD um some people end up getting
[52:42] PhD um some people end up getting full-time roles at um you know other
[52:45] full-time roles at um you know other other big companies. Some people end up
[52:47] other big companies. Some people end up getting roles at Coher and or Coher
[52:50] getting roles at Coher and or Coher Labs. Um, so I think it really just
[52:52] Labs. Um, so I think it really just depends on your journey and what you end
[52:54] depends on your journey and what you end up researching and sort of your
[52:56] up researching and sort of your experience. I think everyone everyone's
[52:58] experience. I think everyone everyone's end journey here has been a little
[53:00] end journey here has been a little different. Um, all really cool to see.
[53:02] different. Um, all really cool to see. Um, but yeah, I think it it really just
[53:04] Um, but yeah, I think it it really just depends on what your goals are um, you
[53:07] depends on what your goals are um, you know, after the program and and sort of
[53:08] know, after the program and and sort of long term.
[53:11] long term. Amomar or Diana, do you want to add
[53:13] Amomar or Diana, do you want to add anything to that to like what happens at
[53:15] anything to that to like what happens at the end?
[53:17] the end? Uh, yeah. I think I would just say like
[53:21] Uh, yeah. I think I would just say like as you're approaching the end of the
[53:23] as you're approaching the end of the program and throughout the program, your
[53:24] program and throughout the program, your mentor is always there to help you. Even
[53:26] mentor is always there to help you. Even if you're not sure what you're going to
[53:27] if you're not sure what you're going to do about it, you have all the time to
[53:29] do about it, you have all the time to think about it throughout the program.
[53:31] think about it throughout the program. Yeah. And what you see?
[53:35] Yeah. And what you see? Uh I also saw one or two questions about
[53:38] Uh I also saw one or two questions about if not selected what advice or
[53:40] if not selected what advice or suggestion would you give to a person
[53:43] suggestion would you give to a person and uh I might put Diana on the spot for
[53:47] and uh I might put Diana on the spot for this one but I think also just like
[53:49] this one but I think also just like adding my two cent it really depends on
[53:52] adding my two cent it really depends on what you want to do in your career and
[53:56] what you want to do in your career and how you want to go about this. So this
[53:59] how you want to go about this. So this is this part program is going to be very
[54:01] is this part program is going to be very competitive and not getting selected
[54:03] competitive and not getting selected doesn't mean the end of the world. There
[54:05] doesn't mean the end of the world. There are different ways to still if you're
[54:07] are different ways to still if you're interested to work with co labs becoming
[54:10] interested to work with co labs becoming part of the community and working on
[54:12] part of the community and working on different initiatives that we launch
[54:15] different initiatives that we launch there. That's one way of doing that. And
[54:17] there. That's one way of doing that. And then there's always next year uh as I
[54:20] then there's always next year uh as I think Diana would tell you. Uh and yeah,
[54:23] think Diana would tell you. Uh and yeah, you never know. There's always going to
[54:25] you never know. There's always going to be other opportunities as well.
[54:28] be other opportunities as well. Yeah, I can jump in here and say that I
[54:31] Yeah, I can jump in here and say that I applied three times. Um I got in on my
[54:34] applied three times. Um I got in on my third time, but that's like uh two two
[54:37] third time, but that's like uh two two years I applied and I didn't get in,
[54:38] years I applied and I didn't get in, right? Um so uh definitely like that's
[54:42] right? Um so uh definitely like that's something that's valued. If you like
[54:44] something that's valued. If you like apply multiple times, it shows that you
[54:46] apply multiple times, it shows that you have sustained interest and you're also
[54:49] have sustained interest and you're also um resilient. Uh so I would definitely
[54:51] um resilient. Uh so I would definitely encourage if anyone here is um has
[54:54] encourage if anyone here is um has applied before and wants to apply again
[54:56] applied before and wants to apply again just just go ahead and do it. Um but
[54:59] just just go ahead and do it. Um but this you know doesn't have to be um the
[55:01] this you know doesn't have to be um the only avenue towards getting into uh
[55:03] only avenue towards getting into uh research. It's that it definitely helps
[55:05] research. It's that it definitely helps um so much but um as Marzia said the
[55:08] um so much but um as Marzia said the community if anyone's not in it yet um
[55:11] community if anyone's not in it yet um it's a really incredible resource.
[55:12] it's a really incredible resource. There's um many talk like multiple talks
[55:16] There's um many talk like multiple talks every week. There's different community
[55:18] every week. There's different community groups where people um discuss various
[55:20] groups where people um discuss various uh areas of research. Um I personally
[55:23] uh areas of research. Um I personally was involved in the YA project which
[55:25] was involved in the YA project which some of you may be familiar with as
[55:26] some of you may be familiar with as well. Um but that was this like
[55:28] well. Um but that was this like tremendous initiative um to gather data
[55:30] tremendous initiative um to gather data from all across the world. Um so there's
[55:33] from all across the world. Um so there's a lot of community opportunities there.
[55:35] a lot of community opportunities there. Um but in general like for anybody I
[55:38] Um but in general like for anybody I would just say um my advice is like
[55:40] would just say um my advice is like continue reading like continue consuming
[55:42] continue reading like continue consuming research um and allow your mind to keep
[55:45] research um and allow your mind to keep working coming up with interesting
[55:47] working coming up with interesting questions and that informs like what
[55:50] questions and that informs like what direction you want to go like what's
[55:51] direction you want to go like what's exciting and compelling to you and um
[55:54] exciting and compelling to you and um maybe can open up potential directions
[55:55] maybe can open up potential directions as well.
[55:58] as well. I I know we are almost at the time
[56:01] I I know we are almost at the time there's a really nice question that I
[56:02] there's a really nice question that I want to ask both of you. uh for Diana
[56:06] want to ask both of you. uh for Diana and Amar, what was the most surprising
[56:08] and Amar, what was the most surprising part of this journey for you? And I
[56:10] part of this journey for you? And I think that's a nice question maybe to
[56:12] think that's a nice question maybe to wrap up and I know a lot of questions
[56:14] wrap up and I know a lot of questions are still there and maybe we can share
[56:16] are still there and maybe we can share some links for uh answers later. But for
[56:19] some links for uh answers later. But for you too, what was the most surprising
[56:21] you too, what was the most surprising part?
[56:23] part? Oh yeah, for me I guess the most
[56:27] Oh yeah, for me I guess the most surprising part was uh mentors. I was
[56:31] surprising part was uh mentors. I was asked this question before and was a one
[56:33] asked this question before and was a one word arsonist the mentors uh it's like a
[56:37] word arsonist the mentors uh it's like a really amazing experiment working with
[56:38] really amazing experiment working with them throughout research coding thinking
[56:40] them throughout research coding thinking about life helpful all the way around
[56:43] about life helpful all the way around and actually we have this
[56:46] and actually we have this like funny story when we uh when all the
[56:49] like funny story when we uh when all the scholars are together at the near the
[56:50] scholars are together at the near the end of the program like every once every
[56:53] end of the program like every once every scholar I meet I keep telling like I
[56:55] scholar I meet I keep telling like I feel like I have the best uh mentor
[56:57] feel like I have the best uh mentor match with me and like the reply from
[57:00] match with me and like the reply from them come like I also feel the same way.
[57:02] them come like I also feel the same way. So yeah, like a super great experience
[57:04] So yeah, like a super great experience working with all of the scientists at
[57:07] working with all of the scientists at Cohit Labs and at Coh as well.
[57:09] Cohit Labs and at Coh as well. That's very sweet.
[57:14] Um I definitely echo the part about the mentors. I I feel the exact same way. Um
[57:20] mentors. I I feel the exact same way. Um and yeah, again, just like you can even
[57:22] and yeah, again, just like you can even talk to people who are not your mentors
[57:24] talk to people who are not your mentors and they're very kind. That's been
[57:26] and they're very kind. That's been great. But I feel like personally for me
[57:28] great. But I feel like personally for me the most surprising part has been that
[57:30] the most surprising part has been that like
[57:32] like I am capable of like doing all of these
[57:35] I am capable of like doing all of these things like like there are a lot of
[57:37] things like like there are a lot of things that were really scary um in over
[57:41] things that were really scary um in over the course of this program. For example,
[57:42] the course of this program. For example, like writing a first author paper and
[57:45] like writing a first author paper and submitting it is like terrifying. Um
[57:47] submitting it is like terrifying. Um it's something that I've wanted to do
[57:49] it's something that I've wanted to do for many years but didn't feel like it
[57:51] for many years but didn't feel like it was accessible to me. And when you're
[57:54] was accessible to me. And when you're actually doing it, it's like very
[57:56] actually doing it, it's like very anticlimactic. Um like you press a
[58:00] anticlimactic. Um like you press a button and you expect fanfare and it's
[58:01] button and you expect fanfare and it's like totally fine. But um beyond that,
[58:04] like totally fine. But um beyond that, it's just like you know when you have
[58:06] it's just like you know when you have this really supportive environment um
[58:08] this really supportive environment um and people who are invested in your
[58:10] and people who are invested in your success um and willing to mentor you on
[58:12] success um and willing to mentor you on like how to get through these big things
[58:14] like how to get through these big things um it seems much more attainable and
[58:16] um it seems much more attainable and that that's been like really incredible
[58:18] that that's been like really incredible for me.

[58:29] Um, I know Meline also just mentioned this in the chat, but we tried to get
[58:31] this in the chat, but we tried to get through as many questions as possible.
[58:33] through as many questions as possible. Um, I know there are many that are
