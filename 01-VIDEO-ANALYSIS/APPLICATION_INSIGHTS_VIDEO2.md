## 🌟 **Key Program Philosophy - "Emerging Talent Focus"**

### What They're Looking For:
> **"We are in particular looking for emerging talent and what this means that you can be an early career researcher. You don't necessarily have to have a specific degree and also you don't have to have a published record before."**

**Critical Insight**: **No prior publications might even be better** because they want to provide opportunities to early career and junior researchers.

### Mission Statement:
> **"Our mission, our northstar is we want to change where, how and by whom research is done"**

**Application Strategy**: Emphasize how you represent underrepresented perspectives or alternative pathways into AI research.
