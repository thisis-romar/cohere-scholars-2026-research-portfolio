## Abstract Summary

This research addresses critical robustness challenges in fine-tuned closed-source LLMs, specifically investigating how to maintain in-distribution performance gains while mitigating corresponding robustness losses on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The work demonstrates that large-scale autoregressive LLMs substantially outperform encoder models in robustness despite using less than 2% of training data, and proposes data-centric methods that improve robustness by up to 3.7% through strategic example selection and synthetic data generation.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Closed-Source Model Constraints**: How can we improve robustness when access to model internals and training procedures is restricted to API-only interfaces?

2. **Data-Centric vs Model-Centric**: Can data selection and augmentation strategies match or exceed the effectiveness of internal model modifications for robustness improvement?

3. **Fixed Budget Optimization**: What are the optimal strategies for improving robustness within computational and financial constraints of limited training budgets?

4. **OOD Complexity Adaptation**: How should robustness strategies adapt based on the complexity characteristics of different out-of-distribution datasets?

## Methodology Framework

### Core Experimental Design
- **Fixed Training Budget**: 10,000 instances for direct comparability across methods
- **Baseline Comparison**: Closed-source LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Command R, Gemini-2.0-Flash) vs encoder models with 50x larger datasets
- **OOD Categorization**: Challenge-OOD (below 70% accuracy) vs Standard-OOD datasets
- **Evaluation Scope**: Seven diverse NLI test sets spanning adversarial, scientific, and commonsense domains

### Strategic Sampling Approaches

#### 1. Uncertainty Sampling
- **Method**: Select high-entropy predictions from baseline model
- **Rationale**: Target ambiguous or under-represented cases in training distribution
- **Implementation**: Top K examples with highest entropy over soft predictions
- **Key Insight**: Balances informativeness with label correctness

#### 2. Difficulty Score Sampling
- **Method**: Few-shot LLM assessment of instance difficulty (1-10 scale)
- **Innovation**: Leverages LLM capability for meta-cognitive difficulty evaluation
- **Extended Scoring**: Incorporates correctness, plausibility, and fluency assessments
- **Efficiency**: Reduces computational overhead compared to gradient-based methods

#### 3. Misclassified Sampling
- **Method**: Upsampling baseline model misclassifications
- **Theoretical Basis**: Minority example learning from prior robustness research
- **Challenge**: High annotation error rate (54%) limiting effectiveness
- **Insight**: Difficulty alone insufficient without label quality consideration

#### 4. Hypothesis Concatenation Sampling
- **Method**: Create complex instances by concatenating hypotheses with shared premises
- **Label Assignment Rules**: Contradiction > Neutral > Entailment priority hierarchy
- **Innovation**: Synthetic complexity generation from existing data without external augmentation
- **Performance**: Improves Challenge-OOD (+1.15%) but reduces Standard-OOD (-0.69%)

### Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline

#### 1. Zero-Shot Generation Framework
- **Domain Diversity**: 51 distinct domains spanning workplace, historical, technical, and cultural contexts
- **Complexity Scaling**: Short & Simple → Long & Simple → Long & Complex generation
- **Quality Control**: "If in doubt, discard" validation using eight-prediction consensus
- **Domain Examples**: Technical reports, Shakespeare extracts, medical procedures, investment banking explanations

#### 2. Advanced Generation Strategies
- **Multi-Part Relationships**: Hypotheses relating to multiple premise components
- **Structural Complexity**: Four-sentence premises with contextually dependent relationships
- **Contradiction Sophistication**: Contradicting one sentence while relating to another
- **Entailment Precision**: Strict logical implications from specific premise portions

#### 3. Label Quality Optimization
- **Consensus Validation**: Retain only examples with unanimous eight-prediction agreement
- **Domain-Specific Filtering**: Remove meta-linguistic artifacts and generation markers
- **Error Rate Management**: 4-16% annotation errors vs 54% in misclassified sampling
- **Quality-Performance Trade-off**: Balance label accuracy with instance diversity

## Major Findings

### 1. Closed-Source LLM Superiority

**Key Discovery**: Autoregressive LLMs dramatically outperform encoder models in robustness across all test conditions.

**Evidence**:
- **Challenge-OOD**: 10+ percentage point advantage over encoder models
- **Training Efficiency**: Superior performance with <2% of encoder model training data (10k vs 550k instances)
- **Consistent Advantage**: Maintained across GPT-4o-mini, Command R, and Gemini-2.0-Flash
- **Scale Independence**: Benefits persist across different model sizes and architectures

**Strategic Implications**: Large-scale autoregressive models represent fundamental architecture advancement for robust language understanding, not merely scale effects.

### 2. Complexity-Dependent Strategy Optimization

**Key Discovery**: Optimal robustness strategies depend critically on OOD dataset complexity characteristics.

**Evidence**:
- **Challenge-OOD**: Uncertainty Sampling achieves +1.45% improvement through complex example prioritization
- **Standard-OOD**: Synthetic data generation provides +3.7% improvement through diversity enhancement
- **Method Specialization**: Different approaches excel in distinct complexity regimes
- **Transfer Limitations**: Methods effective for one complexity level may harm performance in others

**Practical Framework**: Requires adaptive strategy selection based on anticipated deployment complexity rather than universal approach.

### 3. Quality-Difficulty Balance Optimization

**Key Discovery**: Optimal robustness improvement requires careful balance between example difficulty and label quality.

**Evidence**:
- **Misclassified Sampling**: Highest difficulty (5.92/10) but excessive annotation errors (54%)
- **Uncertainty Sampling**: Strong difficulty (5.26/10) with manageable errors (24%)
- **Quality Threshold**: Performance improvements require maintaining annotation accuracy above critical threshold
- **Error Tolerance**: Up to 24% error rates acceptable if difficulty sufficiently increased

**Design Principle**: Effective robustness methods must simultaneously maximize informativeness while controlling label noise.

### 4. Synthetic Data Effectiveness Patterns

**Key Discovery**: Generated data effectiveness depends on semantic diversity rather than surface complexity.

**Evidence**:
- **Length Paradox**: Short & Simple Generation outperforms Long & Simple Generation
- **Complexity Value**: Long & Complex Generation maintains Challenge-OOD performance
- **Domain Coverage**: 51-domain generation provides broad representational diversity
- **Consensus Validation**: Eight-prediction agreement improves Challenge-OOD performance by +1.30%

**Strategic Insight**: Diversity in entailment relationships more valuable than syntactic or lexical complexity.
