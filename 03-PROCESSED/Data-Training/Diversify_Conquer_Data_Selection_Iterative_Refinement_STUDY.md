## Abstract Summary

This research addresses a critical question in LLM training: How can we determine the optimal subset of data for effective instruction tuning? The work proposes a diversity-centric approach using k-means clustering combined with iterative refinement, demonstrating that global diversity features outperform local quality-focused methods. The approach achieves 7% improvement over random selection and 3.8% improvement over state-of-the-art methods across natural language reasoning, world knowledge, code, and mathematical reasoning tasks.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Diversity vs. Quality Priority**: Should data selection prioritize global diversity features or local instance quality for optimal training outcomes?

2. **Optimal Clustering Strategy**: What clustering objectives (k-center vs k-means) and sampling methods most effectively preserve dataset representativeness while maintaining quality?

3. **Iterative Refinement Value**: Can early training signals improve subset selection through iterative resampling and cluster weight adjustment?

4. **Scalable Parameter Selection**: How can we efficiently determine optimal clustering parameters without expensive hyperparameter exploration?

## Methodology Framework

### Core Approach: k-Means Quality (kMQ)
1. **Clustering Phase**: Apply k-means clustering to group similar instruction samples
2. **Quality Sampling**: Sample from each cluster proportionally with quality-weighted probability
3. **Budget Allocation**: Assign cluster budgets proportional to cluster size (bⱼ = |Xⱼ|/|X| · b)
4. **Diversity Preservation**: Ensure representation from all clusters to maintain global diversity

### Iterative Refinement Pipeline
1. **Initialization**: Select initial subset using kMQ with budget b/N
2. **Training Feedback**: Fine-tune model for one epoch, generate inference on sampled data
3. **Difficulty Assessment**: Score quality difference between generated and gold completions
4. **Weight Adjustment**: Modify cluster sampling weights based on aggregated cluster scores
5. **Resampling**: Select new candidates with updated weights, repeat until budget exhausted

### Technical Innovation
- **Clustering Objectives**: Systematic comparison of k-center vs k-means for instruction data
- **Silhouette Score Optimization**: Efficient proxy for determining optimal cluster number k
- **Multiple Scoring Methods**: Comparison of perplexity, GPT-4, and reward model scoring
- **Cross-Model Validation**: Testing across Llama-2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3-8B

## Major Findings

### 1. Diversity-First Sampling Superiority

**Key Discovery**: Simple diversity-focused approaches outperform sophisticated quality-first methods.

**Evidence**:

### 4. Cross-Model Transferability Patterns

**Key Discovery**: Method effectiveness varies across model families with distinct transfer characteristics.

**Evidence**:
- **Mistral Success**: Strong performance improvements maintained across Mistral-7B
